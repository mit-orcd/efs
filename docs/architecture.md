This is the **normative specification** — the index of architectural truth.
It states the goal, the failure model, the consistency contract, the
invariants, where every piece of state lives, which protocol governs each
operation, and the performance contract. Rationale, derivations, and full
protocol detail live in the linked satellites; **if this file and a
satellite disagree, this file wins.** The [scaling
roadmap](scaling-roadmap.md) is the *increment plan* for the current
implementation; this is the *specification*. When a design question comes
up, the answer is decided here first, then reflected in the roadmap.

**Status: ratified Sep 1 2026; revised Sep 1 2026 after external protocol
review (seven rounds — see [design history](arch/design-history.md)).** The
metadata layer described here replaces the current whole-table snapshot +
2PC design. The data path is unchanged in mechanism (client-direct RDMA,
k+f EC) but its commit semantics are specified precisely (§7.3). The bar
for the design is that it earns the *idea* of an "extreme filesystem": it
scales as close as possible to the raw hardware — a component is wrong if
it serializes work the hardware could have done in parallel
([naming](arch/naming.md)).

---

## 0. Governing principles

Four principles decide every hard case below. When a design question has no
obvious answer, the answer is whichever option these four point to.

- **P1 · Never serialize work that the semantics and the hardware allow to
  happen in parallel.** A component is wrong if it serializes work the
  hardware could have done concurrently. The filesystem must not invent a
  conflict merely because two operations share an inode, a file, or a
  directory. Serialization is accepted only where the *semantics* demand it
  (O_APPEND EOF allocation, overlapping byte ranges, truncate, rename).
- **P2 · Co-locate what must commit atomically on the common path; distribute
  what can evolve independently.** Before reaching for a distributed
  transaction, first ask whether the two pieces of state can be placed so the
  common operation is one Raft entry on one shard. This is the answer to the
  extending-write problem (§7.3): chunk publication and its size lane share a
  shard, so they commit atomically with no cross-shard protocol.
- **P3 · Make stale work harmless instead of trying to prevent stale work
  from happening.** Inode generations, content epochs, immutable chunk
  generations, orphan candidate writes, Raft terms, and node incarnations are
  all the same move: a stale actor may *do* work, but it cannot make that
  work *visible*. This is cheaper and more robust than fencing every stale
  actor at every boundary.
- **P4 · The hot I/O path never crosses cores, NUMA nodes, or software locks
  unnecessarily.** A distributed design that scales perfectly on paper still
  fails the goal if each node leaves half its hardware idle. Ordinary
  PUT/GET and metadata commits run NUMA-local, asynchronous, queue-depth
  driven, zero/minimal-copy, with no cross-core lock on the common path
  (§8).

## 1. Goal

A high-performance parallel POSIX file system.

| Property | Target |
|---|---|
| Objects (files + dirs) | ≥ 2³² (4.29 billion) **live** |
| Cluster size | 3 nodes (smallest) to 64 nodes |
| Reference size | 2³² objects on 4 nodes |
| Failure tolerance | **configurable f = 1…3** simultaneous node losses (§2); no data loss at the configured f; requires N ≥ max(2f+1, k+f) |
| Consistency | immediate cross-client visibility (no TTL caches) |
| Data path | client-direct, RDMA, k+f EC (k=2 default) |
| **Scaling bar** | throughput scales with the **protection-adjusted** aggregate hardware ceiling (§9); no software serialization point may become the limiter before a physical resource does |
| **Hardware envelope** | **modern flash only** — NVMe SSDs + RDMA-capable NICs. Hard disks are explicitly out of scope (below) |

**Hardware envelope: flash/NVMe-only, by decision.** EFS does not support
spinning disks, and no design effort is spent on them. This is not an
omission — it is a scoping decision that the architecture actively spends:

- **Random I/O is first-class.** There is no seek penalty to hide, so no
  seek-aware layouts, no write-sequencing-for-disks, no elevator thinking.
  The KV pager's random page faults and the read path's random chunk reads
  are *cheap* by assumption.
- **Deep hardware queues are assumed.** The P4 execution model (§8) —
  asynchronous, queue-depth-driven, one NVMe queue pair per reactor — only
  exists because the devices do. A HDD cannot run that model at all.
- **Microsecond device latency is what the durability choice costs against.**
  `write()` = durable (§7.3) pays a synchronous round trip to *device*
  per write; that is affordable because the device is µs-scale flash, not
  ms-scale disk.
- **No SMR/shingled, no rotational-latency hiding, no track alignment** —
  entire problem classes deleted, not engineered around.

If a deployment needs HDDs, that is a different filesystem; efs's scaling
claims (§9) are made against flash and do not transfer.

The 2³²-on-4-nodes number is the binding constraint. It forces metadata out
of RAM and onto local NVMe, and forces the metadata store to be paged rather
than serialized whole. The scaling bar forces the *write path* — not just the
read path — to parallelize across nodes and across clients, including many
writers to the **same** file.

The scaling bar, stated measurably: **for operations without semantic
conflicts, EFS throughput must scale with the aggregate protection-adjusted
NIC, NVMe, CPU, and memory bandwidth of the participating nodes. No software
serialization point — a mutex, one inode leader, one metadata thread, FUSE
serialization, one WAL, one coordinator — may become the limiting resource
before one of those physical resources does.** When a scaling benchmark stops
early, the answer to "where did it stop" must be a physical resource (NIC,
NVMe, memory bandwidth, EC compute, fabric bisection); if the answer is
software, that is by definition an EFS bug. "Near-linear" is defined per
workload class in §9 — several POSIX operations are serial *by semantics* and
are excluded from the claim rather than silently failing it.

## 2. Failure guarantees

**Assumptions.**

- Nodes fail by crashing (stop, restart, rejoin). No Byzantine behavior.
  **"Losing a node" means its storage is gone**, not just the process — the
  guarantees below are for permanent loss; a crash-with-intact-disk is a
  strictly easier case covered by the same configuration.
- The network can drop, delay, reorder, duplicate, and partition messages.
  Partitions heal.
- Clocks are loosely synchronized (NTP). Used for expiry/TTL and cache hints
  only — **never** for correctness of replication, fencing, or reads. In
  particular there are **no clock-based leader leases** on the authoritative
  read path.
- A node that loses its local storage rejoins empty and rebuilds from peers.
- Clients are **fail-stop / non-Byzantine**: they may crash, disconnect,
  retry, duplicate, or hold stale state, but they are not adversarial.
  Authorization/fencing at storage targets is therefore about *stale*
  clients, not malicious ones (§7.3). If efs is ever exposed to hostile
  clients, capability-based data authorization becomes a requirement, not an
  option.

**The rule.** The cluster is configured with a failure target **f** — the
maximum number of simultaneous permanent node losses it must survive
**without data loss** — capped at **f = 3** and bounded by cluster size.
(The cap is deliberate: metadata quorum size and EC storage overhead both
grow with f, and f=3 already covers the realistic correlated-failure
envelope for a single rack/cluster.) The two planes scale differently with
f: a `k+f` EC stripe survives any f data losses and needs N ≥ k+f distinct
failure domains; a Raft group stays authoritative through f permanent
losses only if the survivors still form a quorum, which needs
**N ≥ 2f+1**. So the configured-f guarantee is one line:

```text
N ≥ max(2f+1, k+f)        RF = 2f+1 voting replicas per shard
```

Lose any f nodes: a metadata majority survives, ≥k data fragments survive,
and the system remains authoritative **automatically** — no quorum override,
no disaster mode, no distinction between "bits survive" and "we can prove
which bits were committed."

| N nodes | max f | metadata RF | data EC | guarantee |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | 1 | 3 | 2+1 | lose 1: no loss, stays authoritative |
| 4 | 1 | 3 | 2+1 | lose 1: no loss, stays authoritative |
| 5 | 2 | 5 | 2+2 | lose 2: no loss, stays authoritative |
| 6 | 2 | 5 | 2+2 | lose 2: no loss, stays authoritative |
| ≥ 7 | 3 | 7 | 2+3 (or wider k, e.g. 4+3 = 1.75×) | lose 3: no loss, stays authoritative |

**f=3 needs 7 nodes, not 5 or 6.** On 5 nodes the best metadata
configuration is RF=5, Q=3, and 3 ≯ 3 — the 3 dead nodes could be exactly
the quorum that acknowledged the most recent writes. The config validator
rejects any configuration that violates N ≥ max(2f+1, k+f).

**There is no N = 2f mode.** After a permanent majority loss, no local rule
over surviving logs can reconstruct the committed prefix — commitment
information died with the majority, and splicing survivor logs can
manufacture a command sequence no leader ever authorized. Permanent majority
loss is disaster territory (an operator procedure over surviving state), not
an efs operating mode. (Full argument:
[failure-tolerance.md](arch/failure-tolerance.md).)

**Changing f or k is an online control-plane operation** with an explicit
`effective_f` → `target_f` transition state: add shard replicas (joint
consensus, §7.8), re-stripe every protected data generation to the new k+f
width as **new immutable generations under the new coding profile** (§7.3),
verify, and only then commit the new guarantee. Derivation and transition
detail: [failure-tolerance.md](arch/failure-tolerance.md).

## 3. Consistency contract

- **Single-shard metadata operations are linearizable** within the
  authoritative shard's Raft group.
- **Multi-shard metadata operations are atomic** across their participant
  shards according to the cross-shard transaction protocol (§7.2). The
  intended property for those is strict serializability of transactions.
- There is **no global ordering** between two independent operations on
  unrelated shards, and none is needed.
- **Data:** a `write()` that has returned success is durable and visible (see
  the precise commit state machine in §7.3). Un-`fsync`ed data can be lost on
  client crash only where POSIX permits it.
- **One `write()`/`pwrite()` publishes atomically.** POSIX makes regular-file
  `read()`/`write()` effects atomic with respect to one another, so a
  concurrent reader never observes a mix of old and new chunks from a single
  in-flight write: publication is one atomic decision covering every chunk
  the call touched (§7.3), while the *data movement* stays fully parallel.
  The atomicity unit is **one FUSE write request**; `max_write` is sized so
  the writes that matter arrive as one request. Full syscall-level atomicity
  *above* that boundary is an open kernel-interface problem — FUSE
  async-DIO can split a syscall without identifying it — and EFS **does not
  claim** it until solved (§7.3 states the unresolved contract and the
  investigation paths). Once a call has returned, every subsequent read
  sees all of it. An explicit **relaxed mode** (mount option, for
  applications that synchronize themselves — MPI-IO-style) publishes chunk
  by chunk for maximum publication throughput; it is documented as weaker
  than POSIX and is never the default.

**Readdir concurrency contract (explicitly weak, by design).** POSIX leaves
readdir-under-concurrency loose, and efs takes that room rather than
promising distributed snapshot isolation. A `readdir` scan guarantees:

- every returned name **existed at some point during the scan**;
- **no name is returned twice** within one scan (the ordered-KV cursor is
  monotonic per shard; a spread-directory merge dedups by name);
- a `telldir` **cookie remains valid** for resuming the scan (it encodes the
  per-shard cursor position; a leader change does not invalidate it, since
  the KV state — not the leader — is what is scanned);
- a name that existed for the *entire* scan **may** be missed only if it was
  concurrently renamed/moved across the cursor boundary — the same allowance
  local POSIX filesystems make.

It does **not** promise a point-in-time snapshot: a concurrent create may or
may not appear, a concurrent unlink may or may not disappear. If a future
feature needs snapshot readdir, that is an MVCC read (rejected for now —
[design.md](arch/design.md)) introduced deliberately, not an accident of the
scan.

**CAP-accurate availability.** At the configured failure target f (§2,
which requires N ≥ 2f+1): any f nodes may be permanently lost with **no
data loss**, and every shard retains a quorum after the losses, so
operations remain available to clients that can reach it — no operator
action, ever. A minority partition never serves authoritative writes or
stale authoritative reads. Brief unavailability during leader election is
expected. "Survive f nodes" means safety always, plus continued operation
whenever a quorum survives — not literally zero interruption for every
client.

## 4. Invariants

These are the test oracle for the simulator
([verification.md](arch/verification.md)) and for `fsck`. A bug is a
violation of one of these. Invariants are stated over the **committed,
externally-visible projection** of state; cross-shard transaction *intents*
(§7.2) are internal and are governed by I17/I18, not by the naïve forms of
I6/I7.

**Replication / leadership (Raft's actual safety properties)**

- **I1 · election uniqueness.** At most one server is elected leader for a
  shard in a given term.
- **I2 · leader completeness.** Every subsequently elected leader contains
  every previously committed entry. (This follows from Raft's election
  restriction + log-matching + commit rules together — not from majority
  intersection alone.)
- **I3 · term fencing.** A node that observes a higher term immediately stops
  exercising old-term leader authority.
- **I4 · quorum acknowledgement.** No metadata mutation is acknowledged unless
  committed according to the shard's *currently authoritative* Raft
  configuration. ("No dual owner" refers to commit authority, not a node's
  subjective belief — a partitioned old leader may still believe it leads but
  cannot commit.)

**Metadata state**

- **I5 · name uniqueness.** Within a directory, one visible name maps to at
  most one inode.
- **I6 · no visible dangling dentry.** Every committed visible dentry resolves
  to a valid inode.
- **I7 · nlink.** `nlink` equals the number of committed visible namespace
  links.
- **I8 · no resurrection.** A committed namespace removal is never reverted by
  replay, recovery, rebuild, or a stale client.
- **I9 · absent ≠ unavailable.** A failure to establish authoritative read
  state never returns `ENOENT`. `ENOENT` is only ever returned for a name
  that is genuinely absent; every resource, availability, or integrity
  failure surfaces as a distinct retryable error instead. **This is a safety
  invariant, not an error-reporting nicety:** a false "absent" answer to a
  LOOKUP lets the next CREATE mint a *second* inode for an object that is
  still live, which violates I5, I6, and I7 and leaves no evidence that it
  happened. A read path that can fail is therefore required to fail
  *loudly*, never by answering "no".
- **I10 · metadata durability.** An acknowledged committed metadata op
  survives any f simultaneous permanent node losses, where f is the
  configured failure target (§2; quorum Q > f by construction).
- **I16 · request idempotency.** Replaying a mutation with the same operation
  ID cannot apply its logical effect more than once and returns a response
  compatible with the original completed operation.
- **I17 · transaction atomic visibility.** A cross-shard transaction is
  externally visible as committed everywhere or not committed anywhere.
- **I18 · safe reconfiguration.** No shard configuration transition permits
  two disjoint authoritative quorums for the same logical history.
- **I19 · open-unlinked lifetime.** An inode with `nlink=0` remains valid for
  pre-existing authorized open handles until those references are safely
  retired; it is never reclaimed or reused while such access is valid.

**Data**

- **I11 · EC durability.** A generation published in a **healthy** cluster
  has all k+f fragments durable on distinct failure domains, so any f
  simultaneous losses leave at least k reconstructable fragments. A
  generation published while `u` failure domains are **already unavailable**
  has at least `k + (f − u)` durable fragments, is marked degraded, and is
  repaired when capacity returns (§7.3).
- **I12 · chunk consistency.** Every returned chunk corresponds to one valid
  committed generation and a legal serialization of the committed byte-range
  mutations.
- **I13 · generation coherence.** A reconstruction never mixes fragments from
  different generations. Generation identifiers are globally unique candidate
  identities scoped to `FileID = (ino, inode_generation)`, so no two writers
  and no two incarnations of an ino can ever produce different bytes under
  one identity (§7.3).
- **I14 · publish-after-durability.** Metadata cannot publish generation G
  before G satisfies the EC durability requirement.
- **I15 · orphan-generation safety.** Fragments from a generation that was
  never published may be reclaimed without changing any committed state.
- **I20 · stale-writer fencing.** A stale client/node cannot overwrite or
  publish data over a newer committed chunk generation.
- **I21 · publish+size atomicity.** An extending write never commits its
  chunk publication without the corresponding size-lane update, nor the
  reverse — they are one Raft entry on one shard (§7.3). A reader never sees
  a size that covers unpublished bytes, nor published bytes that no committed
  size exposes.
- **I22 · epoch fencing.** A publication naming a superseded content epoch is
  never committed, and size/time lane state from a superseded epoch is never
  read. The epoch fences *in-flight work and lane state* — it does **not**
  invalidate committed chunk data, and it is not part of a fragment object's
  identity: a `truncate()` to a smaller non-zero size preserves the surviving
  prefix, as POSIX requires (§7.3).
- **I25 · end-to-end integrity.** Every durable fragment is protected by a
  checksum over its immutable identity plus its payload. A fragment that
  fails verification is never used as reconstruction input; it is treated as
  unavailable and repaired (§7.3).
- **I23 · session fencing.** A fenced (superseded) client session cannot
  perform any **authoritative mutation**: it cannot commit a metadata
  operation, publish a data generation, acquire or retain a lock, an open
  reference, or an append reservation, or make stale work visible. Metadata
  leaders enforce the epoch; data targets need not. Fencing is a **barrier,
  not an announcement**: no consequence of the old session's death (lock
  reclaim, lease drop, reservation resolution) may take effect until every
  shard that could act on the old epoch has durably acknowledged the fence
  (§7.5).
- **I24 · atomic write publication.** Within the atomicity unit (one FUSE
  write request, ≤ `max_write`; the syscall-boundary problem above that
  size is explicitly open, §7.3): a returned `write()`/`pwrite()` is
  visible in its entirety to every subsequent read, and a concurrent read
  during the call sees either all or none of that call's chunks (default
  mode; §7.3).

**Liveness (testable bounded forms)**

- **L1.** With a stable quorum and eventually-delivered messages, each shard
  eventually elects a leader.
- **L2.** Every committed op is eventually applied by every healthy replica.
- **L3.** A restarting replica with intact storage eventually catches up.
- **L4.** An empty replacement replica eventually catches up and can safely
  join.
- **L5.** Every prepared cross-shard transaction eventually reaches COMMIT or
  ABORT while the required quorums remain reachable.
- **L6.** Zero-link orphan inodes eventually reclaim after references
  disappear.
- **L7.** Unpublished EC generations eventually reclaim.
- **L8.** Reconfiguration eventually converges desired placement to actual
  placement once failures stop.

## 5. State placement

**Three planes, not two.**

- **Data plane** — chunk PUT/GET, k+f EC (§2, §7.3), client-direct over RDMA.
- **Metadata plane** — virtual shards, one Raft group per shard at
  RF = 2f+1 (§2, §7.1), ordered applied KV on NVMe.
- **Control plane** — cluster membership, desired placement, shard
  reconfiguration, node incarnation, drain/rebuild. Its own Raft group
  (§7.8), and *not* an implicit authority for operations it does not itself
  make safe.

**Identity and addressing.**

- **`efs_ino_t` is 64-bit.** The target is ≥ 2³² *live* objects, so the ID
  space must exceed that to cover deleted/recreated objects, avoid dangerous
  immediate reuse, tolerate stale client handles, and leave headroom.
- **Inode generation / incarnation.** Each inode carries a generation that
  changes on reuse, so a stale handle for a deleted `ino` never silently
  becomes a handle for a new object (ABA protection). A handle is
  `(ino, generation)`.
- **`FileID = (ino, inode_generation)` scopes every persistent data-plane
  identity** — fragment objects, chunk-map entries, write lanes, append
  reservations, publication intents. A bare `ino` is *not* sufficient there:
  a fragment PUT issued by a delayed writer for the previous occupant of
  ino 100 would otherwise land inside the new object's key space. ABA
  protection has to cover the data plane, not just handles (§7.3).
- **Allocation.** Inos are allocated in per-shard (or per-allocation-domain)
  ranges so allocation is shard-local and globally unique by construction.
  The exact scheme (range handout vs. `[domain | counter]`) is an
  implementation detail; the invariant is global uniqueness + ABA protection.
  **Allocation is also the mechanism behind CREATE co-location (§7.4).**
  Placing a new file's inode row on its parent directory's shard is not a
  second, competing placement rule — it is a constraint on *which range the
  ino is drawn from*: the allocator picks an ino whose `ino & 0xFFF` already
  equals the parent's shard. `inode_shard()` therefore stays a pure function
  of the ino, and no operation ever needs an exception to it.

**Sharding.** **4096 metadata shards**: `shard = ino & 0xFFF`
(`shard_bits = 12`). Low-bit masking yields **interleaved buckets**, not
contiguous ranges — sequentially-allocated inos then balance across shards
naturally. A shard is ≈ 1M inodes at the 2³² target; shards are cheap and a
node hosts many.

**Where every piece of state lives (authoritative).**

| State | Authority | Key | Replication |
|---|---|---|---|
| inode row | `inode_shard(ino) = ino & 0xFFF` | `(ino)` | shard Raft group (RF = 2f+1) |
| dentry, LOCAL layout | parent's shard | `(parent_ino, name)` → `(ino, gen, type)` | shard Raft |
| dentry, HASHED layout | `hash(parent_ino, name) & 0xFFF` | `(parent_ino, name)` → `(ino, gen, type)` | shard Raft |
| chunk map | lane shard (§7.3 permutation) | `(FileID, lane, chunk_index)` | shard Raft |
| size / write mtime / write ctime | write lane, co-located with the chunk's lane shard | `(FileID, lane)` | shard Raft |
| active-lane bitmap, `base_size`/`base_mtime`/`base_ctime`, `content_epoch` | `inode_shard(ino)` (inode row) | `(ino)` | shard Raft |
| directory mtime / ctime, HASHED layout | each of the directory's dentry hash shards | `(dir_ino, shard)` | shard Raft |
| client session, touched-shard set | `hash(client_uuid) & 0xFFF` | `(client_uuid)` | shard Raft |
| open lease | `inode_shard(ino)` | `(ino, session_id)` | shard Raft |
| POSIX locks | `inode_shard(ino)` | `(ino, start, end, owner)` | shard Raft |
| transaction decision | `participant[hash(txid) % participant_count]` | `(txid)` | shard Raft |
| membership / desired placement | control-plane group | — | control Raft (RF = 2f+1) |
| file data | k+f distinct failure domains by placement | `(FileID, chunk_index, candidate_generation, fragment_index, coding_profile_id)` | k+f EC fragments |

**Applied state: a logical ordered KV per shard.** Each replica applies its
log to a **local, embedded, ordered key-value store** on NVMe. RAM is a
bounded cache, not the store. Each shard has an isolated ordered
applied-state *namespace*; the implementation multiplexes many shard
namespaces into one local storage engine via a shard-prefix key (at 64 nodes
a node hosts ~192 shard replicas at RF=3, ~448 at RF=7 — while *leaders*
stay ~64/node at any RF, which is what matters for write scheduling).
Ordered keys make readdir a range scan. A log + KV is the durability
mechanism; snapshots exist only for **log truncation**, never as the
durability mechanism. **Capacity model (honest):** real persistent
consumption is `(N_inodes × inode_value_size + N_dentries ×
dentry_value_size + names) × KV_amplification × RF`, plus Raft log,
snapshots, tombstones, transaction and dedup state, and compaction headroom
— with `N_dentries ≥ N_inodes` (hardlinks). NVMe capacity is designed
around this explicitly; it is not a "2³² × 128 B fits" claim.

**A cache miss is never absence.** Because RAM is a bounded cache over the
KV rather than the store itself, every miss must be resolvable from local
applied state. When it cannot be — I/O error, corruption, or an evicted
entry whose backing is gone — that is a **resource** failure and must
surface as a distinct retryable error (I9). This is a real failure mode
rather than a hypothetical one: a bounded cache whose miss path is allowed
to fail silently is precisely how a live row comes to read as a missing
object, and the read path is the one place where that mistake is
unrecoverable (see I9 for why).

## 6. Operation → participant matrix (authoritative)

Derived from the placement rules (§5) and the CREATE co-location rule
(§7.4). This matrix is the authority on which shards an operation touches.

| Op | State touched | Shard(s) | Protocol |
|---|---|---|---|
| CREATE (file) | dentry + inode row | **1** (co-located) | single Raft entry |
| MKDIR | dentry + parent `nlink` on parent shard + dir inode on its home shard | 2 | transaction (§7.2) |
| RMDIR (LOCAL dir) | dentry + parent `nlink` + dir inode row; emptiness is one range check | 2 | transaction (§7.2) |
| RMDIR (HASHED dir) | as above **+ emptiness across the directory's dentry shards** | 2 + used hash shards | transaction with the emptiness check in its read set (§7.4) |
| UNLINK (last link) | dentry + inode row | **1** if `dentry_shard == inode_shard` (and nlink==1), else 2 | single Raft entry / transaction |
| UNLINK (nlink>1) | dentry on parent shard, nlink on inode shard | 2 | transaction (§7.2) |
| LOOKUP (name only) | dentry | 1 | single read |
| GETATTR (stat) | inode row **+ the file's active write lanes** (size/mtime/ctime merge, §7.3) | 1 + active lanes (1 for a small file, ≤64) | double-collect (§7.3) |
| GETATTR (stat) on a HASHED directory | dir inode row + the directory's used dentry shards (mtime/ctime merge, §7.4) | 1 + used hash shards | double-collect (§7.4) |
| SETATTR | inode row | 1 | single Raft entry |
| LINK (hardlink) | new dentry on its parent shard, nlink on inode shard | 2 | transaction (§7.2) |
| RENAME same-dir (LOCAL dir) | two dentries on parent shard | **1** in the simple no-replacement case; replacing a destination whose inode lives on another shard widens the participant set | single Raft entry / transaction (§7.2) |
| RENAME same-dir (HASHED dir) | two dentries on `hash(parent, old)` and `hash(parent, new)` — independent shards | ≥2 | transaction (§7.2) |
| RENAME cross-dir (file) | src dentry, dst dentry, ino row, parent nlinks | ≥2 | transaction (§7.2) |
| RENAME cross-dir (directory) | as above **+ the destination's whole ancestry chain as a versioned read set** (cycle prevention, §7.4) | ≥2 + O(depth) | transaction (§7.2) |
| WRITE non-extending | chunk-map entry | 1 (lane shard) | single Raft entry |
| WRITE extending | chunk-map entry + that lane's size/mtime/ctime marks | **1** (co-located, §7.3) | single Raft entry |
| WRITE first use of a lane | as above + `active_lanes` bit on the inode row | 2 | transaction (§7.2); ≤64 times per file, ever |
| O_APPEND | EOF reserve + chunk + size | inode shard + lane shards | reserve (§7.3) then write |
| TRUNCATE | `content_epoch` + `base_size` + times on inode row | 1 | single Raft entry (§7.3) |
| READDIR | dentries | 1 (normal) / many (spread) | range scan / scatter-merge |
| CHMOD / CHOWN | inode row (ctime, **not** mtime) | 1 | single Raft entry |

(The UNLINK-last-link row is conditional because of a hardlink corner case:
after `create /a/foo; link /a/foo /b/foo; unlink /a/foo`, the surviving dentry
is on `/b`'s shard while the inode row is on `/a`'s — the final unlink of
`/b/foo` is then a two-shard transaction.)

## 7. Protocol summaries

Each protocol is stated here in binding summary; the linked document is its
full specification.

### 7.1 Sharded Raft and linearizable reads

Each shard is an independent Raft group at **RF = 2f+1** (§2), replicas on
distinct failure domains. Each group elects its own leader; leaders spread
across nodes, so metadata write throughput scales with node count — there is
no single metadata primary. Every mutation is a log entry `(term, index)`,
committed when a majority of the group's replicas hold it durably; this is
what makes I1–I4 and I10 true. The 4096 logical groups run on a **multi-Raft
runtime** (reactors per NUMA domain, messages batched by destination,
heartbeats coalesced, WAL group-committed across groups, KV applies batched)
— an architectural requirement, not an optimization
([performance.md](arch/performance.md)).

Authoritative reads (LOOKUP/GETATTR/readdir) go to the **shard leader**,
which establishes quorum-backed read authority (ReadIndex-style) and waits
until its applied index covers the read before reading the KV. There are
**no clock-based leader leases** (clocks are never correctness inputs, §2).
Read authority is **amortized**: one quorum round serves a whole batch of
requests — the read-side analog of publication batching (§7.3).

Invariants: I1–I4, I9, I10, I18.

### 7.2 Cross-shard transactions

EFS uses conditional prepared intents plus one durable distributed decision.
Intents are never externally visible until the decision commits (I17).
Prepares are **conditional** (`prepare(T, key, expected_version)`) and
**no-wait**: a conflicting prepare fails immediately, the loser aborts its
intents and retries with randomized backoff — nobody ever waits while
holding an intent, so deadlock is impossible by construction. **Independent
prepares run in parallel**; write-publication transactions (hot path, §7.3)
always prepare in parallel, while rare namespace transactions prepare in
canonical key order to minimize retry churn. The coordinator is dispersed —
`participant[hash(txid) % participant_count]` — so same-file write
transactions never funnel into one shard.

**Only exclusive keys take intents.** A transaction's effects are either
**exclusive/CAS keys** (chunk-map entry, dentry, inode row — one holder,
version-checked) or **commutative reductions** (`MAX` on a lane's size and
times, or a hashed directory's times). Reductions are transaction *payload*,
applied by the reducer at resolve time, and never block a prepare —
otherwise two writers publishing different chunks that share a lane would
conflict on nothing, and the per-file hotspot the lanes exist to remove
would reappear one level down (P1).

A transaction is visible **at its decision**, not when cleanup runs; a
reader meeting an intent resolves COMMIT → new value, ABORT → old value,
NO-DECISION → old value (the read linearizes before the eventual decision),
and **cannot-establish-authority → a retryable error, never "absent"** (I9).
Recovery drives every prepared transaction to COMMIT or ABORT (L5); resolved
intents are GC'd, while decision records are retained until every
participant has acknowledged them.

Invariants: I16, I17; the namespace transactions it carries (MKDIR/RMDIR,
LINK, cross-shard UNLINK and RENAME — §6) additionally preserve I5–I7.

### 7.3 Data publication

A write commits through: allocate chunk generation → encode + store k+f
fragments (client-direct RDMA) → **ALL k+f durable fragment ACKs** →
Raft-commit the publication (chunk map + lane marks) → apply → return.
**"Durable ACK" = the target completed the persistent-NVMe operation**
(flush/FUA or PLP media), not an RDMA completion. A returned `write()` is
durable and visible — stronger than POSIX, a deliberate latency-for-
durability trade. Degraded publication (with `u` domains already
unavailable) needs ≥ `k+(f−u)` fragments, is marked degraded, and is
re-striped on repair — never for a merely *slow* target (I11).

**Identity.** Every data-plane key is scoped by
`FileID = (ino, inode_generation)`, so a delayed PUT from a previous occupant
of an ino cannot enter the new object's key space. A generation identifier is
a **globally unique candidate identity, never `G+1`**: successor numbering
would let two concurrent writers PUT different bytes under one object name.
Ordering comes from the publication `CAS(expected = committed base)`; the
loser's object is an orphan it retries over (P3, I13).

**Lanes.** Chunk metadata is sharded into **64 fixed per-file write lanes**,
activated on use rather than sized in advance — a runtime-derived lane count
would relocate every chunk-map key when it changed.

```text
lane(ci)                 = chunk_index % 64
lane_shard(FileID, lane) = (inode_shard(ino) + lane * stride(ino)) & 0xFFF
stride(ino)              = 2 * (hash(ino) & 0x7FF) + 1        (odd)
```

An odd stride over a power-of-two shard count is a permutation, so the lanes
are **64 distinct shards** (independent hashing would collide); **lane 0 is
the inode's own shard**, so a small file has no fan-out. A monotonic 64-bit
`active_lanes` bitmap on the inode row is set on a lane's first use — ≤64
inode interactions per file *lifetime* — and `stat()` collects only active
lanes, as a **double collect** over per-lane sequence numbers (bounded
retries, read-only transaction fallback).

An extending write is **one Raft entry on the lane shard**:
`{publish chunk (CAS); MAX(lane.max_end); MAX(lane.max_mtime);
MAX(lane.max_ctime)}` (I21).

**Times.** Write-generated mtime *and ctime* both live in the lanes; routing
write ctime to the inode row would send every hot-file writer back to the
inode leader. Explicit changes update the inode row's `base_*` under
`mtime_gen`, keeping POSIX's distinction exactly (`chmod` sets ctime, not
mtime). **atime is `noatime` by default**, `relatime` a coalesced mount
option; strict per-read atime is deliberately not offered.

**Truncate** bumps the content epoch and stamps the inode's `base_size`: it
invalidates lane state and rejects in-flight publications of the old epoch,
but **does not invalidate committed chunk data** — the surviving prefix stays
readable, as POSIX requires (I22). **O_APPEND** serializes only the EOF
reservation and the visible frontier (which advances over contiguous
*resolved* reservations; a fenced appender's range resolves as a committed
zero hole); data movement is parallel. **Sub-chunk writes** use generation
CAS; disjoint ranges both land (I12), and pay RMW amplification by design.

**One write syscall publishes atomically** via a §7.2 transaction (I24). The
atomicity unit is **one FUSE write request**, and **EFS MUST NOT claim full
POSIX write atomicity above the `max_write` boundary** until FUSE async-DIO
syscall splitting is solved — an explicit unresolved contract. A documented
relaxed mount mode publishes per-chunk (§3).

**Data targets are dumb — so publication is the validator.** A fragment PUT
is immutable and idempotent; the target verifies only placement epoch, target
incarnation and object identity, and does not check sessions (§7.5). Since
nothing on the data path enforces the coding/placement contract, the
publication entry carries its **durability evidence** (`coding_profile_id`,
`placement_epoch`, per-fragment ACK set with target incarnations and
checksums) and the lane leader **rejects evidence that does not match the
current profile, the current placement, all k+f fragment roles, and the
required distinct failure domains** — a stale client can durably write a full
stripe to an obsolete placement and still not publish it. The metadata
authority alone decides which generation is visible (I15, I20).

**Every durable fragment carries a checksum over its identity plus payload**
(I25). Media corruption is not Byzantine, and EC without integrity checking
reconstructs confidently from a corrupt fragment; a fragment failing
verification counts as unavailable and is repaired, never decoded.

Invariants: I11–I15, I20–I22, I24, I25.
Full protocol: [protocols/data.md](arch/protocols/data.md)

### 7.4 Directory placement and spreading

A dentry lives on its **parent's shard** as a small projection
`(ino, gen, type)`; the inode row is the only mutable copy of anything else.
**CREATE co-location:** a file's inode row lands on its directory's shard
(file CREATE = dentry + inode row in **one Raft entry**); **every MKDIR
scatters** — `inode_shard(new_dir) = hash(parent, name, export_salt) &
0xFFF` — paying one 2-shard transaction to buy an independently scalable
subtree for the directory's lifetime. `EFS_DIR_SPREAD_MIN` is a scalability
bound on the co-located file set, not just a space threshold.

A directory spreads (one-way) on **entry count OR op pressure**, through a
layout-epoch protocol `LOCAL → SPLITTING(e) → HASHED(e)`: during SPLITTING,
writes go only to the hashed location, reads check hashed-then-local, the
migrator moves idempotently, and **mutations of unmigrated entries write a
dominating hashed tombstone** — the hashed side always wins, so nothing
resurrects (I8).

**Directory timestamps spread with the directory.** POSIX updates a
directory's mtime/ctime on every entry create/remove/rename; sending those to
its home shard would funnel every create in a spread directory through one
leader and silently defeat the spread. A HASHED directory therefore keeps a
`dir_lane` (`max_mtime`, `max_ctime`) **on each of its dentry shards** — one
Raft entry per mutation, parent uninvolved — reduced by `stat()` under the
same double-collect protocol as file stat.

**Two operations are not uniformly cheap once a directory is HASHED.**
`rmdir` must prove emptiness, which is distributed: the emptiness check over
the dentry shards is part of the transaction's **read set**, so a concurrent
create invalidates it (an exact distributed entry counter is rejected — it
rebuilds the hotspot the spread removed). Same-directory `rename` is a
two-shard transaction, since `hash(parent, old)` and `hash(parent, new)` are
independent.

**Directory rename carries an ancestry read set.** POSIX forbids moving a
directory beneath itself, and checking that by walking the tree is unsound:
two concurrent renames can each validate a legal tree and together create an
unreachable cycle. Every directory row carries `parent_dir` +
`parent_version`; a directory rename puts the destination's whole ancestry
chain at those versions **into its conditional PREPARE**, so any concurrent
reparent in the chain aborts it. O(depth) and rare.

Invariants: I5–I8.
Full protocol: [protocols/directory.md](arch/protocols/directory.md)

### 7.5 Client sessions and fencing

Every client operates under a **session** `{client_uuid, session_epoch,
state}`, committed via Raft on the session shard `hash(client_uuid) &
0xFFF`. Every mutating request carries `(client_uuid, session_epoch,
op_id)`; **shard leaders reject a superseded epoch** (I23). Heartbeat loss
only decides *when* a replacement may be attempted; **consensus decides
which session is authoritative**.

**Revocation is a barrier, not an announcement.** Committing `epoch+1` fences
nothing by itself: a shard that has not heard of it, acting on its own view of
E, can still commit for the dead client. The session record therefore carries
the **set of shards registered to act on it** (a 4096-bit bitmap; registration
is once per shard per session, never on the I/O path), and the transition is
three-phase:

```text
ACTIVE(E) -> FENCING(E+1)  [freeze the touched set; no new registrations]
          -> FENCE(E+1) to every touched shard; each durably rejects E,
             resolves its undecided work, and ACKs
          -> ACTIVE(E+1)   [only after every ACK]
```

Nothing that depends on the old session being dead — lock reclaim, open-lease
drop, append-reservation resolution — happens before that last commit. An
unreachable shard makes the *new* session wait: the correct availability-for-
safety trade, and not a real loss, since a shard that cannot establish
authority cannot commit for the old client either. Dedup records survive the
bump (I16), reclaimed on a bounded window rather than kept per operation.

**Data targets do not fence sessions** — an orphan fragment PUT is harmless
because publication is exclusively metadata-controlled (P3). Fencing a
partitioned-but-alive client is an availability sacrifice, never a safety
one; the session epoch is the fencing token.

Invariants: I23, I16.
Full protocol: [protocols/sessions.md](arch/protocols/sessions.md)

### 7.6 Open-unlinked files and POSIX locking

Open lifetime is **one session-scoped open lease per (session, inode)** on
the inode shard: committed at the session's first open of the inode, removed
at its last close, lazily dropped when the session is fenced. Reclaim
requires `nlink == 0 AND open_sessions == empty` (I19, L6). Cost: one Raft
entry at each end of a session's use of a file — not per descriptor, not
per I/O.

Locks: **one lock authority per inode** on `inode_shard(ino)`, records
`(ino, start, end, owner)` mutated via Raft — a semantic serialization (P1),
accepted because a locking application asked for coordination. Owners are
`(client_uuid, session_epoch, process_id)`; fenced sessions' locks are
reclaimed. efs reproduces the **Linux** contract: classic `fcntl`,
**OFD `fcntl`** (POSIX.1-2024, included), and `flock` are three
non-interacting namespaces on the same authority (`flock` is not POSIX; the
non-interaction is Linux behavior). Advisory locks never fence the data
path.

Full protocol: [protocols/sessions.md](arch/protocols/sessions.md)

### 7.7 FUSE / kernel interface contract

Kernel metadata caches: `entry_timeout = negative_timeout = attr_timeout =
0` plus explicit invalidation through the low-level (inode-based) FUSE API.
**File data: direct-I/O by decision** — the kernel page cache is bypassed,
so cross-client data visibility is exactly as strong as metadata visibility,
with no coherence protocol to get wrong. Coherent caching may return later
only if it materially pays and only after zero/stale-cache semantics are
demonstrably correct without it. **Cross-client coherent `MAP_SHARED` is
unsupported initially** (documented limitation; `MAP_PRIVATE` unaffected).

The FUSE layer must not re-serialize what efs parallelized — requirements,
not tuning: `FOPEN_DIRECT_IO`, `FOPEN_PARALLEL_DIRECT_WRITES`,
`FUSE_CAP_ASYNC_DIO`, `FUSE_CAP_PARALLEL_DIROPS`, large
`max_write`/`max_pages`, sufficient `max_background`. `FUSE_CAP_ASYNC_DIO`
is in deliberate tension with write atomicity — see the unresolved contract
in §7.3. Direct-I/O disables kernel readahead, so **the client owns an
adaptive asynchronous prefetch pipeline** — a performance requirement of
the direct-I/O decision (§9). FUSE-over-io_uring is evaluated as the
interface matures.

### 7.8 Control plane, membership, and reconfiguration

The control plane is its own Raft group (RF = 2f+1): cluster membership,
desired shard→node placement, node incarnation, drain/rebuild. **Desired
placement ≠ authoritative configuration** — each shard's own group
transitions its actual membership through an overlapping-quorum
(joint-consensus) path, e.g. `{A,B,C} → joint{A,B,C,D,E} → {B,D,E}`, and a
replacement replica catches up before becoming a voting member (I18). Every
process/storage incarnation carries `(node_uuid, storage_incarnation,
process_boot_id)`; delayed packets from an old incarnation are rejected.

### 7.9 Request idempotency

Every mutating request carries a stable logical identity —
`(client/session UUID, request sequence)`. The replicated state machine
records enough completed-request state to make ambiguous retries idempotent
(I16) — critical for O_APPEND, create, link, unlink, rename, truncate,
mkdir. One `txid` threads through all participants of a cross-shard
transaction (§7.2).

**That state is a bounded window, not a history.** At this scale "one durable
record per operation, kept forever" is an unbounded table on every shard, so
what is retained per `(client_uuid, session_epoch)` is a
`highest_contiguous_seq` watermark, a small completion bitmap for the ragged
out-of-order edge above it, and a bounded reply cache for operations that
could still be retried. Records are reclaimable once the session is fenced,
its outstanding ambiguity is resolved (§7.5), and the retention window has
passed; transaction decision records have the matching participant-ACK
condition (§7.2).

## 8. The hot-path performance contract

Binding requirements, each traceable to P1/P4 — the difference between "the
architecture scales" and "the implementation scales." Full contract with
rationale: [performance.md](arch/performance.md).

- **NUMA-local, asynchronous, queue-depth-driven execution.** Ordinary
  PUT/GET and ordinary metadata commits take no cross-core lock and make no
  thread-to-thread handoff; NIC RX queues affinitize to reactor cores that
  drive NUMA-local NVMe queue pairs.
- **QoS isolation between planes.** Raft, membership, transaction decisions,
  and small metadata RPCs get their own RDMA queues / traffic class /
  credits, separate from bulk data; on NVMe, WAL, KV, bulk fragment I/O, and
  rebuild I/O have separate queues and backpressure.
- **Rebuild is distributed and rate-limited.** Deterministic repair owner,
  reads from distributed peers, never centralized; priority is foreground
  I/O > metadata > rebuild.
- **Read-side metadata is fetched in windows.** Per-lane batched range
  chunk-map fetches (lane i holds chunks i, i+64, i+128, …), with the
  metadata window running ahead of the data window; per-chunk lookups only
  for true random I/O.
- **Batching everywhere.** Raft messages, WAL group commit, KV applies,
  chunk publications, read-authority rounds: **no persistence boundary is
  paid per chunk, per metadata record or per Raft group when several
  operations can safely share one.** Durability boundaries are amortized to
  the largest batch the externally visible semantics allow — they are not
  eliminated, because a returned `write()` is durable (§7.3) and therefore
  crosses one.
- **FUSE capabilities and client prefetch** per §7.7.

## 9. The scaling envelope

"Raw hardware" must be **protection-adjusted**: protection consumes
hardware, so for k+f EC a logical chunk of size C writes `(k+f)/k × C`
physically (1.5× at 2+1). The ideal ceiling for logical write bandwidth is
approximately

```text
min( aggregate client egress        × k/(k+f),
     aggregate storage-node ingress × k/(k+f),
     aggregate NVMe write BW        × k/(k+f),
     EC encode CPU / memory bandwidth,
     metadata publication rate × chunk size )
```

plus smaller metadata/network overheads. The bar is a **high fraction of
that protection-adjusted ceiling** (85–95% would be extraordinary), and the
hot-path contract of §8 exists precisely to remove the software terms from
that min(). The data path is client-direct RDMA + EC; the hot-file metadata
path publishes on bounded per-file lanes rather than serializing on an inode
row (§7.3). Metadata op cost is one leader RTT + a majority replication —
the floor for any consistent system — and it no longer degrades with table
size or with same-file concurrency.

**"Near-linear" is defined per workload class** — several POSIX operations
are serial *by semantics*, and the claim excludes them explicitly instead of
silently failing them:

| Workload | Expected scaling |
|---|---|
| Many files, large aligned I/O | **near-linear with nodes** |
| One file, disjoint full chunks (many writers) | **near-linear up to the file's lane count / cluster size** |
| One giant `write()` syscall | data movement parallel; one atomic visibility decision per syscall (§7.3) |
| Many independent directories | **near-linear** — every directory scatters at birth (§7.4) |
| One spread hot directory | **near-linear across its hash shards** |
| One normal small directory | single-shard until size/pressure spreads it |
| Large sequential reads | near-linear **if userspace prefetch keeps queue depth high** (§7.7) and chunk maps are fetched in per-lane windows (§8) |
| `O_APPEND` on one file | reservation order + visible commit frontier serialized by semantics; data movement parallel (§7.3) |
| Overlapping same-range writes | serialized by semantics (CAS retry) |
| `truncate` on one file | content-epoch serialization (§7.3) |
| Cross-directory rename storm | transaction-throughput limited (§7.2) |
| Same-file `fcntl` lock storm | inode lock-authority limited (§7.6) |
| 4K random updates in 128K chunks | RMW limited — declared envelope (§7.3) |

A scaling benchmark is then a scientific question — *where did it stop: NIC,
NVMe, memory bandwidth, EC compute, fabric bisection?* — and any answer that
is a mutex, one leader, one thread, FUSE serialization, one WAL, or one
coordinator is by definition an EFS bug (§1).

## 10. Implementation order

Not a big-bang rewrite. Order chosen so each step is gated and the system
stays runnable. **Do not** go straight `KV → Raft → done`.

```text
0. Freeze the exact metadata placement model:
   inode_shard() · dentry_shard() · authoritative row ownership ·
   inode IDs + generations · FileID scoping of every data key (§7.3) ·
   the CREATE co-location rule (§7.4) ·
   the 64-lane permutation + active-lane bitmap (§7.3).
1. Simulator interfaces + the CURRENT state machine.
2. Define RPC operation IDs + the idempotency model.
3. Ordered KV applied state, incl. atomic batch semantics.
4. Single-shard Raft: persistence · election · replication · apply ·
   ReadIndex/linearizable reads · snapshots.
5. Simulator proves the single-shard invariants.
6. Safe Raft-group reconfiguration + control-plane desired placement.
7. Cross-shard transaction protocol, incl. concurrency control (§7.2).
8. Client sessions + fencing (§7.5), then the open-unlinked inode
   lifecycle (§7.6) on top of them.
9. Data-generation publication / fencing integration (§7.3), with the
   simulator checking the logical data protocol (arch/verification.md).
10. Directory layout-epoch spread (§7.4) + distributed locking (§7.6).
11. Delete the old snapshot / root-2PC machinery.
12. FUSE cache-coherence optimization only after zero/stale-cache semantics
    are demonstrably correct (data path starts as direct-I/O, §7.7).
```

**Step 1 has a hard prerequisite: the carve-up.** A pure state machine behind
transport/storage interfaces does not exist today — four files hold ~45% of
the tree and the state machine is fused with its I/O. So the *concrete* first
move is **Phase M** in the roadmap: carve the monolith into `raft/ kv/ meta/
wire/ data/ client/` behind interfaces
([development.md](arch/development.md)), as behavior-preserving refactor
gated by the existing suites. It is the dev-cycle lever in its own right
*and* the thing that makes step 1 possible — the simulator can only reuse a
state machine that is already pure. Build nothing in steps 2–11 as new
monolith code; every new component lands inside the carved boundaries.

The detailed, gated steps live in the [scaling roadmap](scaling-roadmap.md);
this document is the invariant they are measured against.

---

## Appendix: terms

- **Shard** — an interleaved bucket of the inode space (`ino & 0xFFF`); the
  unit of replication and leadership.
- **Raft group** — the RF replicas + log for one shard (RF = 2f+1 at the
  configured failure target).
- **Leader** — the single writer for a shard in a given term.
- **Term** — a monotonically increasing leadership epoch; used for fencing.
- **Committed** — present on a majority of the group's current authoritative
  configuration.
- **KV** — the embedded on-disk ordered key-value store holding applied state
  (one logical namespace per shard, multiplexed into a shared local engine).
- **Control plane** — the small Raft group that owns cluster membership and
  desired placement.
- **FileID** — `(ino, inode_generation)`; the incarnation-scoped identity that
  keys every persistent data-plane object, so a reused ino cannot inherit a
  predecessor's in-flight writes.
- **Chunk generation** — the immutable version of a logical chunk's fragment
  set, named by a **globally unique candidate identity** (never a successor
  number); publication is atomic via metadata commit, and ordering comes from
  the publication CAS.
- **Coding profile** — the `{k, f, stripe/coding epoch, placement epoch}`
  identity of a generation's erasure coding; changes online, never mutated
  in place.
- **Write lane** — one of a file's 64 fixed metadata lanes; a lane shard holds
  the chunk-map entries plus the size/mtime/ctime high-water marks for its
  chunks. Lanes map to distinct shards by an odd-stride permutation, and lane
  0 is the inode's own shard.
- **Active-lane bitmap** — the inode row's monotonic 64-bit record of which
  lanes a file has ever used; it bounds what `stat()` must collect.
- **Commutative reduction** — transaction payload applied by a reducer
  (`MAX` on a lane's size/times), as opposed to an exclusive CAS key; it
  never blocks a prepare.
- **Content epoch** — the inode's content generation; bumped by truncate to
  invalidate lane state and reject in-flight stale publications. It is a
  fence, not part of any object's identity.
- **Session** — a client's `{client_uuid, session_epoch, state, touched
  shards}` record on its session shard; the epoch is the fencing token, and
  the touched-shard set is what the revocation barrier fences.
- **Intent** — a durable prepared record written by a participant in a
  cross-shard transaction; never externally visible as a committed effect.
