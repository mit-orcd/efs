# External comparison wording — superseded Oct 7

Retained rationale wording; use the [sourced current discussion](../how-it-works/design-rationale.md). This is not an exhaustive prior-art search or a current product feature matrix.

systems get close to individual parts — WEKA (fully distributed data +
metadata, no dedicated MDS tier, hash placement, strong POSIX, NVMe), DAOS
(NVMe-native, low-latency fabric, distributed transactions, EC, versioned
writes — though its POSIX layer still lacks hardlinks and distributed flock),
VAST (distributed transactional metadata + EC + flash, but a shared-everything
DASE model, not shared-nothing Raft shards), CephFS (client-direct data +
dynamic metadata, but authority in a distinct MDS tier). IndexFS/GIGA+
precede the threshold-spread huge-directory idea. FoundationDB is the
canonical deterministic-simulation example. We are not claiming to have
invented any of these.
