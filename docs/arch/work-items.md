# Work items — long-form text for the open W items

Companion to [START-HERE.md](START-HERE.md). START-HERE holds the queue,
the plan and the decisions; this page holds the full text of the open
long-form items that the plan rows point at: the source evidence, the
numbered steps with their status, and the binding **Forbidden** list.
Nothing here is a queue position — the order is START-HERE §1a. A step
marked done here is a document claim about the date given; the gate
result directory is the evidence. Closed items (W1–W5, W7, W11, W13,
W26, W28–W35) are in [project-history.md](../project-history.md)
"START-HERE closed items". `§1b <time> block` references point at the
"START-HERE handoff archive" there. Every item below opens with its
current status, remaining action, governing decision and gate; what
follows that block is the dated record. W23 is the server compaction
item; the client connection-liveness item is W49 (renamed Oct 2).

**Durability and visibility.** The normative statement is
[architecture.md §3](../architecture.md) (the three "Data —" bullets) and
is not repeated here — earlier copies drifted. Vocabulary used by the
items below, defined there: a buffered byte is *pending* (not yet
published, in flight, or retrying on contention), *transiently failed*
(one drain hit a transport/budget failure: that `fsync`/`flush` returns
EIO, the byte stays pending) or *stalled* (D27: sticky EIO on every
description until it lands, bytes retained). Publication happens at
`fsync`, at every `flush`, and at the D24 landed-PUT REPORTs; `release`
publishes nothing; `fsync` waits for this client's writes only.

#### W6 — Run IO-500 (IOR easy, IOR hard, mdtest) — CORRECTNESS DONE, perf residuals open

> **Current status (Oct 2 2026; a document claim — the cited gate directory is the evidence):** correctness DONE (Sep 20; every IO-500 phase, 0 read errors). Of the three perf residuals: (1) ior-hard-write rate is W17/D1 (span publish in the tree, Sep 30 36-rank hard-write 0.640 GiB/s, 0 errors) with W38 (fold tombstone, 1 read error Oct 1) the open residual; (2) 1 GiB open is D2, implemented (`open()` adopts the row only; see the project-state rule); (3) rmdir rate fixed Sep 27.
>
> **Remaining action:** none under this number. W38 is plan row 4 in [START-HERE.md](START-HERE.md) §1a; hard-write scaling beyond that is measured by the 9×4 debug run after each roll.
>
> **Governing decision:** D1 (span publish commutes), D2 (open adopts the row), D3 (no raised REAP gate). A chunk lock stays forbidden.
>
> **Gate:** IO-500 9×4 debug: every phase finishes, 0 `-R` errors on both reads, cold `hardscan bad=0` (`results/io500/20261001-074905-rdma` has the one W38 error; `20260930-183504-rdma` is the 0-error reference).

**Historical record (dated).** Evidence and steps as they were written at the time. A step marked *done* or *superseded* in the status block above is not to be executed; its text stays so the gate directories and the reasoning remain findable.

**Correctness gate met Sep 20 2026** (commit `cc828d8`, servers
`708b350`+, TCP, 9 clients × 4 ranks): 9×4 debug
`results/io500/20260920-debug-9x4/` — **every phase finished, ior-easy-read
and ior-hard-read 0 verification errors, every unlink OK**. The path from
the Sep 18 numbers (hard-write DNF in 2 h 18 m, `-W` 4244 errors, 76108
easy-read errors, 27 undeletable files) to this is in
[../project-history.md](../project-history.md) "W6"; the fixes were: client
STALE retry cost + server partial-commit on STALE (hard-write livelock);
`dcache_image_current` / `snap_seq` ordering / forwarded-cmd reply index
(read coherency, `concurrent_appends`); Raft follower dedupe + leader AE
flow control (005 catch-up); **duplicate ino on concurrent CREATE**
(`alloc_hint_or_next` — apply is the allocator); reaper `lane-sweep`
batch-full misread as error (no file >8 MiB/lane was ever reclaimed).

Not a list submission (stonewall 1 s). Do not quote the Sep 19 easy-read
4.0 GiB/s — it was zero-fill. Do not quote stonewall intra GiB/s.

**Open under this item (performance, not correctness):**

1. **ior-hard-write** — **spans are the data path (Sep 27).**
   NP=4, SEGS=3000, 47008 B, one file, cold remount: write
   **481.56 MiB/s** (1.12 s), read **91.35 MiB/s** (5.89 s), pattern
   12000 records bad 0. posix2 **63/63**
   (`results/posix2/20260927-190509`). Prior curve
   `results/measure/20260921-162514-ior-hard-scaling`: **372 / 33 /
   69 / 82 MiB/s at 1 / 4 / 9 / 36**, about half of REPORTs
   `EFS_ERR_STALE`. The 4-rank point moved 33 → 482. 1/9/36 were not
   remeasured: group 2's REAP_DONE tail stayed ~11–16 entries/s
   (distinct inodes) and preflight fails above 5/s. Do not raise it
   (**D3**). Do not add a chunk lock. Do not tune 47008.
   **Sep 28, NP=9 via `run.sh ior`: STALE storm, fsync EIO, D-state
   ranks — W17.** **Decision D1 (Sep 28): the span publish commutes
   (no base-gen CAS for spans; sub-range writers always publish spans;
   fold by the chain-filler or a reader). Implement as W17 step 3.**
2. **1 GiB open costs 20 s of a 22 s easy-read** — 128 sequential
   GETCHUNKS + a 64-lane stat per open. Spec §8 per-lane range fetch
   ([performance.md](performance.md)) is the fix. **Decision D2 (Sep
   28): `open()` adopts the inode row only; `pull_layout_miss` is the
   one pull path, one GETCHUNKS per lane group in parallel, a metadata
   window one data window ahead of the prefetcher, size adaptive and
   internal (no knob).** Steps: (a) remove `pull_file_layout` from
   adopt for regular files; (b) make `pull_layout_miss` issue the
   window's lane-group GETCHUNKS concurrently and record the covered
   range per ino; (c) have the read prefetcher request the next
   metadata window when the data window advances; (d) keep the 64-lane
   size stat at open (size authority is not the map). Gate: 1 GiB cold
   open under 10 ms with 36 concurrent openers
   (`tests/measure/` open-cost script); easy-read not worse than
   `results/io500/20260928-150609-rdma`; `-R` errors 0 on both reads;
   posix 1 jobs=1 200/201. Forbidden: a whole-map pull anywhere;
   zero-fill on a miss; a mount option or env var for the window.
3. ~~mdtest `rmdir` ENOTEMPTY/EIO under load~~ — **FIXED Sep 21** (it was
   the parent-row lost update, not transient; §7.2 reductions). **Rate
   fixed Sep 27.** The flat 138 / 134 / 159 ops/s
   (`results/measure/20260921-161931-samedir-rate`) was one AppendEntries
   per create: a proposer that arrived while a fsync hold was open
   broadcast that single entry under the raft lock. Those proposers now
   append locally; the hold owner fsyncs the burst and marks every
   covered index durable; the pump sends one batch.
   `results/measure/20260927-211953-samedir-rate` (ROUNDS=100, storm
   PASS, parent `children=0 nlink=2`): **333 / 1385 / 1241 ops/s at
   1 / 9 / 36 procs**, `busy_n` 0 / 0 / 1. Idle mkdir median 3.1 ms.
   Do not change the backoff or the txn protocol. Do not lower
   `EFS_DIR_SPREAD_MIN`.

Harness (`tests/perf/io500/run.sh`): `SLOTS=4 NP=36 … debug` detaches
`prterun` and logs to `$IO500_DIR/last-run.log` (the ssh timeout used to
kill it); `ior-easy-write|verify <mb>` and `ior-hard-write|verify <segs>`
run IOR directly so a cold verify is possible (the io500 driver deletes
its data at the end of a run).

- **Read:** `tests/perf/io500/README.md`; the fio rule's FUSE check
  applies to every rank.
- **Gate (met):** 9×4 debug with 0 `-R` errors on both reads. For the
  three open sub-items the gate is the number in the table moving with
  the same harness and 0 errors kept.
- **Forbidden:** quoting a rank that fell back to local disk; tuning
  IOR's transfer size (47008 is the point); a chunk lock (W1); `pkill -f`
  (matches the agent). Kill hung `io500` with `pkill -9 -x io500`. **Do not remount as the
  next step:** a remount is a client teardown and the killed ranks may
  hold unpublished bytes. Follow D27's procedure in
  [START-HERE.md](START-HERE.md) (decisions table): `scripts/client.sh stop` must
  complete its drain; if it refuses, the stalled recs it lists are part
  of the run's result, and a forced teardown is the explicit
  `--force-discard` only. Until D27 is implemented the 60 s drain
  discards silently — record every `UNMOUNT DATA LOSS` line from each
  client's `fuse.log` with the run. (D-state `request_wait_answer`
  ignores SIGKILL until `efs-fuse` answers or dies.) Never gdb-attach an MPI rank through a timeout'd ssh
  (left a rank T-stopped, job unrecoverable).

#### W8 — 9-node POSIX suite 1 (gate: 201 rows, 0 NOTRUN, every host)

> **Current status (Oct 2 2026; a document claim — the cited gate directory is the evidence):** gate MET (Oct 1: 9-host **200/201 on all nine**, `results/posix/20261001-160049`; the one skip is `mmap_write_read` by spec). Sub-items 0–2 closed (I17 `46d54e6`, I16 op-id window `43bdf6a`, W13 background compaction); sub-item 3's many-op floor was the per-peer sender wakeup bug (Sep 20).
>
> **Remaining action:** none; this is the standing 9-host regression gate. Anything below 200/201 on any host is a regression, not noise.
>
> **Governing decision:** none open.
>
> **Gate:** `tests/run_tests.sh posix` on nine hosts: 200/201 each, 0 NOTRUN, no `[None]` rows, under the 385 s cap.

**Historical record (dated).** Evidence and steps as they were written at the time. A step marked *done* or *superseded* in the status block above is not to be executed; its text stays so the gate directories and the reasoning remain findable.

**State (Sep 21 22:15): 191–195 / 201 on every host, 0 NOTRUN, all nine
finish in ~62 s** (`results/posix/20260922-020950`). History and the
three fixes that got here are in the handoff archive ([../project-history.md](../project-history.md)) (harness clock at
submit; `h->mu` contention after `read_mu`; KV WAL fsync per apply).
Earlier symptoms — nine hosts at the 385 s cap with `[None]` rows
(`results/posix/20260917-191430`), the 1.2 s / 1.03–1.08 s root mkdir,
`rmdir` ENOENT on a just-created name, `EBUSY` after the 10.4 s backoff —
are closed: whole-shard txn scans (`165e779`), stranded txn records
(`9534e53`, `3291c6d`), `read_mu` (`223da15`), peer-pool starvation
(`f10fec0`), harness (`a683def`), view (`4eb1419`), WAL hold (`84a2a55`).

What still fails, in order (details in the handoff archive, [../project-history.md](../project-history.md)):
0. Half-applied cross-shard txns (I17) — **fixed `46d54e6` and gated**
   (Sep 22): freeze both leaders during `same_parent_storm`. The parent
   row stayed consistent (`nlink=5 nents=3` with three real children on
   the run that left names behind; the other run removed the parent).
   `arc_term_miss` moved. Details in the handoff archive ([../project-history.md](../project-history.md)).
1. Retry of a committed non-idempotent op after a BUSY (EEXIST on a
   fresh LINK name, EIO, empty read) → I16 op-id dedup for
   LINK/UNLINK/MKDIR/RENAME. Mechanical, spec §7.9.
2. The synchronous full-L1 compaction: 2.4 s under `h->mu`+`l->mu` on
   every replica at once, costs the leader its term. **Decision.**
3. Six many-op tests at 144 concurrent jobs (mkdir p50 21 ms under
   load; apply 0.3 ms/entry of KV reads). Measure, then decide.

Run it as `bash tests/measure/w8_stall_timeline.sh` (runs the suite,
gives the raft/latency timeline) and read `raft-obs:` from the four
`efsd.log`s. Do not raise the 70 s warmup, the 15 s per-test budget,
or the 400 s suite timeout; do not point the suite at a subdirectory;
do not raise the election timeout.

- **Forbidden:** reporting `[None]` rows as failures, or as passes;
  the clock-at-submit bug coming back (a queued test cannot time out).

#### W9 — The client staging table is unbounded

> **Current status (Oct 2 2026; a document claim — the cited gate directory is the evidence):** DONE (Sep 27: pin rules + LRU evictor, walk of 1M files levels at 233 MB RSS, `results/measure/20260927-w9-walk`). The per-tab floor residual was D18, implemented Oct 1 (`evict_cold_tabs`, `test_stage_evict`). The "Steps, once ratified" list below is **implemented; superseded as instructions**.
>
> **Remaining action:** none.
>
> **Governing decision:** D18 (evict whole cold tabs).
>
> **Gate:** the walk-RSS gate in [../client-cache-design.md](../client-cache-design.md); `test_stage_evict`; posix 1 + 2; `leaks`.

**Historical record (dated).** Evidence and steps as they were written at the time. A step marked *done* or *superseded* in the status block above is not to be executed; its text stays so the gate directories and the reasoning remain findable.

`g_client.export` in `efs-fuse` keeps one row per inode this client has ever
touched and one entry per chunk it has written or pulled, and evicts nothing —
so a client that walks a large namespace holds the whole tree in RAM and the
server-side memory wall reappears per client. This is step 12 part A.
The evictor and the pin rules are in the client as of Sep 27.

The plan, the pin rules that make eviction safe (a report builds its records
out of this table, so evicting a dirty row is data loss), and the gate are in
[../client-cache-design.md](../client-cache-design.md). The Sep 23
recommendation below is in the client as of Sep 27. Posix 1 is
200/201, posix 2 is 59/63, the leak gate is clean, and a cold stat
of 1M files leveled at 233 MB RSS
(`results/measure/20260927-w9-walk`). Done.

**Recommendation (Sep 23), implemented Sep 27:** (1) The pin rules —
dirty / publishing / dirty dcache, ghost with an open fd, in-flight op pin,
live append reservation or lock — are exactly the set of rows whose absence
a report or an open fd could observe; anything narrower loses a write,
anything wider is not a bound. (2) `EFS_CLIENT_META_MB` = 256 MB default,
soft: at ~200–300 B per row plus chunk maps that is on the order of a
million rows, above any FUSE working set we have measured (IO-500 9×4,
the posix suites, `find` over the 410-name root), and a table where
everything is pinned grows and logs once rather than evicting work. Pick
a different number only if a client RSS measurement says so; the cap is
an env var, not a protocol.

Steps as planned Sep 23 — **all implemented Sep 27; superseded as instructions:**
1. Pin bookkeeping: a per-row pin count set by the dirty/publishing sets,
   `efs_open_note`/`close_note` for ghosts, and a scoped pin in every
   dual-apply window (create, rename, link, unlink). Unit test: a report
   built while eviction runs never skips a dirty row.
2. LRU by last-touch tick over unpinned rows; evict chunk maps of clean
   closed files first, then rows. Ghost reclaim at last close.
3. `statfs` from server numbers; `efs_export_fits_page_cap` becomes a
   best-effort early-out (the doc's §4).
4. Gate: `make test`; posix 1 (jobs=1 and 9-host) and posix 2 with no new
   failures; the walk-RSS gate — one client walks a multi-million-file
   tree and RSS stays near the cap where it grew linearly before; the
   valgrind leak gate (eviction is a new free path).

- **Gate:** the walk-RSS gate in that doc, plus posix 1 + 2 and `leaks`.
- **Forbidden:** evicting a row that is dirty, publishing, a ghost with an open
  fd, or pinned by an in-flight op. Bounding it by dropping records instead of
  refetching them.

#### W10 — RDMA — live on 19810 Sep 28, not faster than TCP

> **Current status (Oct 2 2026; a document claim — the cited gate directory is the evidence):** DONE as a transport switch: 19810 and every client run RDMA (`EFS_TRANSPORT=rdma EFS_RAFT_OBS=1`) since Sep 28, suites at the standing signature, 9-client dd 2551–2810 MiB/s (Sep 28) against the TCP bar of 1478–1984 — the step-3/4 speed bar is met by document claim. The Oct 1 RDMA fixes (`getifaddrs` cache, zero-copy send W39) are in the project-state rule.
>
> **Remaining action:** none. Do not roll back to TCP unless a suite fails; do not debug RDMA on 19810 — `tests/rdma_first_inode.sh` is the private gate.
>
> **Governing decision:** none open (W39 done; zero-copy receive is deferred, plan row K).
>
> **Gate:** posix jobs=1 200/201 and 9-host 200/201 on RDMA; `tests/rdma_first_inode.sh` 5/5 on an empty private table.

**Historical record (dated).** Evidence and steps as they were written at the time. A step marked *done* or *superseded* in the status block above is not to be executed; its text stays so the gate directories and the reasoning remain findable.

Sep 28 gate on `db2b88c4802a-dirty` (`EFS_TRANSPORT=rdma`,
`EFS_RAFT_OBS=1`). posix jobs=1 199/201 in 90.1 s
(`results/posix/20260928-033823`); 9-host 199/201 on all nine,
56.7–59.1 s, 0 fail, mmap + xattr SKIP
(`results/posix/20260928-034049`); posix2 63/63 in 76.8 s
(`results/posix2/20260928-034350`). After user xattr, jobs=1 is
**200/201** (`mmap_write_read` SKIP only,
`results/posix/20260928-043918`); 9-host was not remeasured.
9-client 8 GiB dd+fsync
**1326.6** MiB/s, walls 28.55–55.57 s, every file 8589934592
(`results/measure/20260928-033420-dd-wall`). TCP bars are posix
9-host ~13–15 s and 9-client dd 1478. The outbox fix that let
fcstor004 catch up is in this build. The speed bar in step 3
below is still open. Do not roll back to TCP unless a suite fails.

The Sep 27 live switch below was rolled back the same hour. It is
history, not the current cluster.

Private gate passed 5/5 (`tests/rdma_first_inode.sh` on fcstor007).
The live switch (`EFSD_ENV='EFS_TRANSPORT=rdma EFS_RAFT_OBS=1'`,
`roll_efsd.sh --all`, clients remounted `EFS_TRANSPORT=rdma`) did not
match TCP. 9-host posix jobs=1 was 193–196/201, skip
`mmap_write_read`, 0 not-run, duration 385 s on every host
(`results/posix/20260927-044348`). The TCP bar on this tree is
200/201 in 30.4–31.3 s. What failed that passes on TCP: the many-op
tests (`dir_deep_nesting`, `dir_deep_nesting_beyond_64`,
`names_crazy_dirs`, and on some hosts `concurrent_creates_same_dir`
and `mtime_monotonic_many_writes`) hit the 15 s cap, plus a few
EIO/EEXIST one-offs. During that run `apply_max` on fcstor003 stayed
under 1 ms. Step 5 rolled 19810 back to
`EFS_TRANSPORT=tcp EFS_RAFT_OBS=1` the same hour; clients
fcstor007–015 are TCP and a mkdir/rmdir on fcstor007 returned
immediately. Freeze, idle `md_latency`, and the dd rebaseline were
not run on RDMA. Do not debug this on the live cluster.

The private-cluster gap (100 mkdirs, fcstor007, ports 19950–19952)
was two bugs in `src/common/rdma.c`, both fixed in tree and not
rolled. The shared recv poller acked the completion-channel event
and then slept 100 ms, so a work completion already in the CQ
stalled every conn (11 of 100 mkdirs; 9-host posix then hit the
15 s cap). It now harvests again before a 1 ms backstop. Every
SEND also called `ibv_query_qp` and read a port counter, which made
a raft AppendEntries ~380 µs against ~15 µs on TCP; those reads
happen only after a send has already failed. With both fixes, one
clean run was 642 ms RDMA vs 507 ms TCP and raft RTT ~50 µs
(`~/efs-runs/rdmaprof7.log`). The Sep 28 live gate is the paragraph
above this section. 19810 is RDMA. The "same numbers as TCP or
better" speed bar is not met.

The steps below are the procedure that was followed, kept so the
gate stays findable.

The client connection-pool lifecycle fix is in tree and unit-gated
(`test_conn_fd`): a pooled conn pins its socket identity, checkout evicts on
mismatch, destroy refuses to close a recycled fd. The **live** repro was never
re-run, because it only reproduces on a freshly `mkfs`'d / effectively empty
table, and 19810 is populated. A remount there is *not* this gate.

19810's transport is RDMA as of the Sep 28 gate (the handoff archive in [../project-history.md](../project-history.md)). Suites pass.
Posix and the 9-client write are still slower than TCP, so the speed
bar in step 3 is open. Every ceiling in the table above assumes the
data path can use the fabric; TCP over IPoIB will not reach it.

**Recommendation (Sep 23): do not wipe 19810 for this.** The repro needs an
*empty* table, not *the* table: `tests/rdma_first_inode.sh` stands up a
private 3-node efsd on one host (fcstor007, ports 19950–19952, storage
under `/tmp/efs-rdma-first`, `EFS_TRANSPORT=auto`) and runs the first
`mkdir`. That is the gate, and it touches nothing on 19810. The live
switch of 19810 to RDMA then needs no fresh table either — the project
state rule records that a populated table drove millions of creates over
RDMA with 0 errors; the empty-table hang was the only open defect. A wipe
buys nothing here that the private cluster does not; keep it for W11
(below), whose gate is easier on a table that grows from zero.

Steps:
1. `efs-bg.sh start w10-first 'bash tests/rdma_first_inode.sh'` with
   `EFS_RUNNER=fcstor007.ib`, ×5 (the tree must be built on 007 first:
   `efsd`, `efs-mgmt`, `efs-fuse`). Pass = every run prints
   `MKDIR_RC=0 WRITE_RC=0` and exits 0 (the first `mkdir` and a write
   inside it each have an 8 s `timeout`). Fail = any `MKDIR_RC=124`, and
   the fix is not in; stop and bring `/tmp/efs-rdma-first/fuse.log`'s
   `RDMA transport|WAIT TIMEOUT|SOCKET CLOSED` lines.
2. Switch the live cluster: `tests/roll_efsd.sh --all` with
   `EFSD_ENV="EFS_TRANSPORT=rdma EFS_RAFT_OBS=1"`, then remount the
   clients with `EFS_TRANSPORT=rdma`. Wait for `commit` flat on both
   groups (post-roll election churn is ~2–5 min).
3. Gate on RDMA, same numbers as TCP or better: posix jobs=1 (200/201),
   9-host posix (≥185/201, 0 not-run), `i17_leader_freeze.sh` ×2 with
   0 worker errors, idle `md_latency.py` within the TCP reference.
4. Re-baseline the write wall (`efs-fio-honest`: 8 GiB dd+fsync 1/4/9
   clients) and record it in the ceiling table of [START-HERE.md](START-HERE.md) §1a. Then TCP is no longer
   the default in the deploy rule and START-HERE.

#### W14 — Server: snapshot install and the fragment probe are on the write path

> **Current status (Oct 2 2026; a document claim — the cited gate directory is the evidence):** DONE by document claim: steps 1 (`7eecf1d`, `bbcbcb5`), 2 (a)–(b) (rolled Sep 29 02:35Z, `drop=0`), 3, 4 (D7 sentinel hint) and 5 landed; the remaining election triggers moved to W22 (D4/D5, done) and to the Sep 30 sender-channel fix (`85f5b31c`).
>
> **Remaining action:** none under this number.
>
> **Governing decision:** D7 (`path_hint = 0xffffffff` sentinel).
>
> **Gate:** no term change on either group during a 9-host posix or a 9×4 IOR; `access()` under 1 % of a single-client dd's server syscalls.

**Historical record (dated).** Evidence and steps as they were written at the time. A step marked *done* or *superseded* in the status block above is not to be executed; its text stays so the gate directories and the reasoning remain findable.

**Status (Sep 28 evening).** Step 1 is done in `7eecf1d` (the diff is
prepared on the GC thread; the pump applies it on the ack) and
`bbcbcb5` (the pump's `host_snap_open` no longer flushes a memtable it
cannot place; a no-progress snapshot ack waits one heartbeat). The
`send_snap` and `kv_flush_locked` stacks are gone from the run-3
profiles. Step 3's reap runs at `efsd` start. Step 4 carries
`path_hint` on the next PUT and probes the other roots only on a
miss. Step 5 sizes the send-buffer pool to `EFS_WRITE_PIPELINE`.
Step 2 (the election trigger) is still open. The
L1 cap that kept fcstor004/005 from compacting is removed in
`bbcbcb5` (growable L1 list; L0 still 64).

**Source (Sep 28 2026, 13:30–13:45 EDT).** `perf record -F 499 -g` attached
to all four `efsd` on 19810 (RDMA, `2f086f5a0ef8-dirty`) while fstor007 ran
`ecopy` and then a `dd` that did not start. Reports:
`~/orcd/scratch/efs/perf/efsd-19810-fcstor00{3,4,5,6}/{flat,by_thread,callers}.txt`.
The recorded binary was replaced on disk by the roll, so user frames are
raw addresses in the reports; resolve them with
`addr2line -f -C -e /tmp/efs/efsd <addr>` on that host (the file there is the
same build). fcstor005, 265K samples:

| share | stack | what |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 16% | pump → `drain_inbox` → `on_snap_req` → `host_snap_chunk` → `efs_kv_group_import` → `efs_kv_scan` (`lsm_scan_from`), `memcmp` 12% self | a follower installing a snapshot: full local KV scan under `l->mu`, then sort + diff of every key, **on the pump thread under `h->mu`** |
| 12% | `writer_thread` → `run_job` → `server_write_fragment_with_sum_sync` → `pwrite` | fragment writes (the useful work) |
| 10.6% | `server_handle_conn` → `recv` (`copyout`) | PUT payloads over TCP |
| 10.4% | `server_handle_conn` → `server_find_fragment_root` → `access()` ×6 (`__d_lookup_rcu`, `link_path_walk`) | six path walks per PUT to find which of the six roots has the fragment |
| 8.6% | `host_gc_thread` → `host_snap_export_pass` → `vx_pop` / `msort` | a leader exporting a snapshot |
| 7.5% | `compactor_main` → `kv_compact_locked` → `cm_push` | L1 compaction |

`raft-obs` in the same window: group 0 changed term at 13:31, 13:37, 13:40,
13:43–13:44; group 2 at 13:39–13:40. Every leader change re-exports and
re-ships a snapshot. Every server holds 5–12 abandoned
`/data1/01/efs/mdraft/snap-*.kvx.tmp` files (34 MB–960 MB each, from 00:41
through 11:24 that day); nothing removes them.

**Why the `dd` did not start.** `create` is a group-0 commit that waits in
`host_wait_settled` for the pump. The pump was inside
`efs_kv_group_import` under `h->mu`, and group 0 was re-electing. The
client's 16 BUSY/NOT_PRIMARY retries back off to 800 ms each, so the
`open()` sat for over ten seconds with nothing printed.

Steps, in this order; each is its own change with its own gate:

1. **Take `efs_kv_group_import` off the pump thread.** The scan and the sort
   run on the GC thread (the export already does). Only the resulting diff
   batch is applied under `h->mu`. `on_snap_req` hands the finished `.part`
   file to that thread and answers the leader when the diff has been
   applied. Gate: `perf` on a follower during a forced InstallSnapshot
   (`tests/measure/i17_leader_freeze.sh` or a bounce of one voter) shows
   `efs_kv_scan` off the pump, and `raft-obs` `apply_max` stays under
   70 ms while the install runs.
2. **Find the election trigger and stop it.** Run
   `tests/tools/raft_log_tail.py` on fcstor004's `raft.log` for the
   13:37 and 13:43 windows. If step 1 removes the term changes under the
   same load, this is done. If not, the follower that cannot answer
   AppendEntries during an import needs the heartbeat answered from a
   thread that is not importing. Do not raise the election timeout.

   **Measured cause candidate (Sep 28 22:19 EDT, after step 1 landed in
   `bbcbcb5`).** Terms still move: group 0 9309 → 9368 and group 2
   2763 → 2789 between 00:39Z and 02:19Z with no roll in between.
   fcstor004 (`raft_id` 1; follower in group 2 whose leader is
   fcstor006 = `raft_id` 3) prints
   `raft-obs: tx->3 enq=50698 drop=72114 sent=50695 hi=2048`: the
   per-peer outbox to the group 2 leader hit `HOST_OUTBOX_MAX` (2048)
   and **dropped more frames than it sent**. `outbox_must_keep` protects
   only `SNAP_REQ` and entry-carrying `AE_REQ`; the victims are
   AppendEntries **replies**, heartbeats, and vote traffic. A leader
   whose follower's replies are dropped re-sends after the `ae_inflight`
   timeout and never sees the match advance; a follower whose heartbeats
   are dropped on the way in campaigns. `rtt_avg=239us` on that link and
   a synchronous request/reply `host_sender` bound one peer link to
   roughly 4 000 frames/s, which the leader's AE rate under 36 writers
   exceeds; the excess is dropped, not queued. `wait_timeouts=366`
   on the same node are the client-visible BUSYs (W16).

   Fixed implementation, in this order:

   **(a)–(b) are in tree and rolled 02:35Z Sep 29.** Gate result: `drop=0`
   on every `raft-obs tx->` line on all four nodes over a 9-client
   `run.sh ior` (was `drop=72114 > sent`), but terms still moved
   (group 0 +45, group 2 +105). The drops were not the trigger; the
   follower's InstallSnapshot import is — see **W22** / D5. `hi` still
   reaches 2048 on fcstor003→1 and fcstor004→2 (entry lane full → AGAIN
   to `send_ae`, no drop), which is (c)'s measurement.

   a. **Coalesce instead of drop.** An AE reply to peer P supersedes any
      older AE reply to P still queued (only the latest `match`/`term`
      matters); a heartbeat (empty `AE_REQ`) supersedes an older queued
      heartbeat to P; a vote/pre-vote message is never dropped. When the
      outbox is full, replace the superseded item in place; only if
      nothing is replaceable return `EFS_ERR_AGAIN` to the caller (as
      `send_ae` already handles for entry AEs). Gate: `drop=0` in every
      `raft-obs tx->` line over a 9-client `run.sh ior`; both groups'
      terms unchanged across the run.
   b. **Do not let one peer's backlog hide a heartbeat.** If (a) leaves
      `hi` at the cap, the sender needs the heartbeat ahead of queued
      entry AEs: dequeue heartbeats and replies before entry AEs
      (two-lane outbox), keeping entry AEs in order among themselves.
   c. **The per-link rate is a design question.** `host_sender` waits
      for `RAFT_REPLY` per frame. Letting more than the one in-flight
      batch ride a link is pipelining and is forbidden below; batching
      several reply frames into one RPC is not, but it changes the wire.
      Measure after (a)+(b): if `hi` still reaches the cap with
      `drop=0`, bring the frames/s and RTT numbers to the user.
3. **Reap dead `snap-*.kvx.tmp`.** At `efsd` start, and whenever an export
   is abandoned (`send_snap` BUSY path, leader step-down), unlink every
   `snap-<group>-*.kvx.tmp` that is not the one in progress. Gate: after
   a roll, `ls /data1/01/efs/mdraft/*.tmp` is empty on all four.
4. **Drop the six `access()` calls per PUT.** **Review after the Sep 29
   02:35Z run:** the hint as specified only helps a re-PUT of the same
   fragment; a first write has no previous PUT to carry a hint from, so
   IOR-easy and a fresh `dd` still walk all six roots (fcstor004: 1.59M
   `access()`, 192 s across six handler threads). **Step 4 (b), decided
   D7 (Sep 29):** the client sends `path_hint = 0xffffffff` when its
   dcache slot has never PUT this fragment generation (no recorded hint,
   not a STALE replay, not a retry of a failed reply); the server then
   skips `server_find_fragment_root` and creates on the writer's
   least-queue root. A fragment name is `{ci}.{fi}.{gen}`, so a first
   write of a new generation cannot collide with an existing file; the
   quota charge stays on the create path. Any re-PUT sends the recorded
   root or 0. Gate: the step-4 gate below (under 1 % on a single-client
   dd) plus `peer_shared_pwrite` / `concurrent_appends` (re-PUT paths
   still probe). Order-table row 8c. A global fd cache hung the
   9-client dd; a thread-local fd cache removed the sample and made the
   slowest client worse (both reverted, see `docs/project-history.md`
   Sep 28). Do not retry either. The PUT reply already tells the client
   which storage path took the fragment; carry that `path_index` back on
   the next PUT of the same `(ino, ci)` as a hint and probe only on a
   miss. Gate: `server_find_fragment_root` under 1% in a single-client
   8 GiB dd profile, and the 9-client dd slowest wall not worse than
   `results/measure/20260928-134637-dd-prof-r5b` (2551.5 MiB/s).
5. **`send_buf_pick` spin.** `pthread_spin_lock` inside
   `efs_rdma_send_frame` is 2.3% of the client and has a server
   counterpart. Size the send-buffer pool per QP so a pick does not
   contend, or hand each sender its own ring. Gate: the spin is gone from
   `flat.txt` on both sides.

- **Gate:** items above, plus posix 1 jobs=1 and 9-host, posix 2, and a
  1-client and 9-client 8 GiB dd with the flush in the clock, none worse
  than the Sep 28 numbers in `.cursor/rules/efs-fio-honest.mdc`.
- **Forbidden:** raising the election timeout or `HOST_TICK_US`;
  chunking InstallSnapshot differently (W11 is done; [../project-history.md](../project-history.md)); the global or
  thread-local fd cache; changing `EFS_RAFT_SNAP_CHUNK`, `HOST_PUB_BATCH_N`
  or `EFS_RAFT_AE_BYTES` (all three were measured worse on Sep 28).

#### W15 — Client: copies and busy-waits are the write CPU

> **Current status (Oct 2 2026; a document claim — the cited gate directory is the evidence):** PARTIAL. Steps 1–2 done (`bbcbcb5`); step 3 in tree for `size == chunk` only; step 4 superseded by W39 (two-SGE zero-copy send, Oct 1); step 5 (`FUSE_CAP_SPLICE_READ`) has its kernel prerequisite (`fs.pipe-max-size`, Sep 29) but no roll record names it as landed — treat as not done. The remaining FUSE write copy is **W40**, deferred until `efsd --bench` (plan row J).
>
> **Remaining action:** none until W40 is taken; then W40's own text. Do not re-profile for this item before the bench.
>
> **Governing decision:** plan row J (W40 deferred); W39 done.
>
> **Gate:** the W28 gate (8 GiB dd+fsync, remount, read) and client CPU per GiB.

**Historical record (dated).** Evidence and steps as they were written at the time. A step marked *done* or *superseded* in the status block above is not to be executed; its text stays so the gate directories and the reasoning remain findable.

**Status (Sep 29).** Step 2 is done in `bbcbcb5`
(`efs_rdma_reply_ready_us` pauses at most 16 times, then the caller
blocks on the CQ fd); on the run-3 profile the vDSO is 0.87% and the
symbol is under the 0.5% floor. Step 1's fresh profile is run 2 /
run 3 (handoff archive, [../project-history.md](../project-history.md)): `ll_write_buf` `memmove` 7.5%, RDMA send `memmove`
6.3% (step 3 stands), and no `memmove` caller under
`dcache_flush_slot_inner` above the 0.5% floor (the body-drop path is
taken). Run 2's client report files were overwritten by run 3 (same
`efs-mount` directory); those three numbers survive only here. The
larger client item was the reclaim walk, W18, which is in tree.
Step 3 hands a whole chunk to the dcache after one `fuse_buf_copy`
(the request buffer does not outlive the reply). Step 4 is the
same send-buffer pool as W14 step 5.

**Source.** `client.sh --perf` on fstor007 during the same `ecopy`
(`~/orcd/scratch/efs/perf/efs-mount/{flat,by_thread,callers}.txt`,
371K samples). This profile is of the binary **before** the Sep 28
dcache changes (full-chunk body drop, no snapshot copy, running
`staged_bytes`); take a fresh one first and strike whatever those already
removed.

| share | where |
| --- | --- |
| 36% | `memmove`: 15.4% in `ll_write_buf` (FUSE copy-in + dcache patch), 3.5% into the RDMA send buffer, the rest under `dcache_flush_slot_inner` (snapshot copy + `dcache_install_image` copy-back) |
| 7.5% + 5.8% | vDSO `clock_gettime` and `efs_rdma_reply_ready_us` from `efs_conn_reply_watch_us`: busy-waiting for the PUT reply |
| 7.1% | `blake3_hash_many_avx512` |
| 5.2% | `efs_export_staged_bytes` (the evictor walk; replaced by a running total Sep 28) |
| 4.6% | `xor_into` (parity) |
| 2.3% | `pthread_spin_lock` in `efs_rdma_send_frame` (`send_buf_pick`) |
| 2.2% | `__lll_lock_wait` from `dcache_put_now` |

Kernel futex + schedule under 3%: the client is not lock-bound. It is
copying and spinning. `ecopy` and `dd` on the same mount were not blocked
by each other; the `dd` was blocked on the server (W14).

**Re-profile, Sep 28 20:36–20:39 EDT (fstor007 `client.sh --perf`,
214K samples, same report dir, binary with the body-drop and
`dcache_ensure` changes).** `memmove` is still 35%. Resolved by call
address (`perf report --no-children --symbol-filter=memmove -g
caller,address` on fstor007): 14.6% under `ll_write_buf`
efs_fuse.c:2569 (the `efs_dcache_try_patch` copy bounce → dcache),
3.6% into the RDMA send buffer, and **~17% with no caller at all**.
That last share is `fuse_buf_copy` in `efs_fuse_write_buf` (libfuse
is built without frame pointers, so the chain stops at `memmove`).
Every written byte is copied kernel → libfuse buffer (`memcpy_erms`
1.6%), libfuse buffer → bounce (`fuse_buf_copy`, ~17%), bounce →
dcache (14.6%), dcache → RDMA send buffer (3.6%). Step 3's gate counts
the bounce copy too, not only the `ll_write_buf` line. `memmove` under
`dcache_flush_slot_inner` is gone (body drop landed). The vDSO share is
back at 5.7%, but from a different place: 2.5% `now_us()` in
`send_buf_pick` (inlined into `efs_rdma_send_frame`) plus 1.7%
`pthread_spin_lock` there — waiting for one of `EFS_RDMA_NSEND` = **2**
pool send buffers per QP; a third 64 KiB PUT on the same conn spins.
That is step 4 / W14 step 5, with its cause named. Two things in this
profile are not on any item and are now **W20** and **W21** (their own sections in this file):
`ll_setattr` → `efs_fuse_getattr_ino` → `fill_stat_from_inode` is 8.9%
(a stat walks every chunk of the file), and `efs_export_staged_bytes`
is 6.6% self on the evictor thread (it was not replaced by a running
total; the per-call loop over `shard_tabs` and up to 1024 passes per
wake are still there).

Steps:

1. **Re-profile on the current binary** (one client, 8 GiB `dd bs=1M
   conv=fsync`, non-zero source, `client.sh --perf`, `stop` writes the
   reports). Record the three shares above again. If `memmove` under
   `dcache_flush_slot_inner` is still above 5%, the body-drop path is not
   being taken for the sequential write; find out why before anything
   else.
2. **Replace the reply busy-wait.** `efs_conn_reply_watch_us` +
   `efs_rdma_reply_ready_us` spin on `clock_gettime`. A PUT reply is
   behind a disk write, tens of milliseconds. Spin for at most ~50 µs,
   then block on the CQ event fd (`rc->efd`) the way `efs_rdma_recv_wait`
   already does. Gate: the two symbols together under 2% on the dd
   profile; the 1-client dd wall not worse.
3. **Cut the FUSE copy-in for whole chunks.** `ll_write_buf` copies the
   libfuse buffer into the dcache. When one write covers a whole 128 KiB
   chunk, hand the libfuse buffer to the slot as the body (the body-drop
   path then sends it and frees it). Check `fuse_buf_copy` ownership in
   libfuse 3.10.2 before assuming the buffer outlives the reply. Gate:
   `ll_write_buf` `memmove` under 5%.

   **Review of the in-tree version (Sep 28 22:00, `efs_fuse_write_buf`
   "W15.3").** It copies once only when `size == cs && offset % cs == 0`,
   i.e. a write of exactly one chunk. `max_write` is
   `EFS_WRITE_PIPELINE × cs` (≥ 1 MiB), so `dd bs=1M`, IOR `-t 1m`, and
   every `cp` deliver 1 MiB writes = eight chunks, and those all fall
   through to the bounce + `efs_dcache_try_patch` path. The 22:11
   profile of this binary shows it: `fuse_buf_copy` ~19% + `ll_write_buf`
   16%. Fixed implementation: walk the write in chunk-aligned pieces.
   For every whole chunk inside `[offset, offset+size)` allocate the
   dcache-owned buffer (`efs_buf_alloc(cs)`), set `dst` to that one
   buffer and call `fuse_buf_copy(&dst, buf, FUSE_BUF_NO_SPLICE)`;
   `fuse_bufvec` keeps the source position (`buf->idx`, `buf->off`), so
   successive calls consume the request buffer in order without a
   bounce; store each with `efs_dcache_store_full_owned`. Only a partial
   head or tail chunk goes through a bounce of its own length into
   `efs_dcache_try_patch`. Keep the O_APPEND reservation and the
   `stage_unpin` exactly where they are. If a mid-write store fails,
   fall back to the old path for the rest of the request (no partial
   success visible to the caller). Gate: on a 1-client `dd bs=1M`
   profile, `memmove` under `ll_write_buf` under 2% and total `memmove`
   with no caller under 5% (that is the single remaining copy); posix
   2 `peer_shared_pwrite` / `concurrent_appends` unchanged.
4. **`send_buf_pick` spin** (superseded by W39) — same as W14 step 5, one change for both
   sides.

   **Review (22:11 profile, `NSEND = EFS_WRITE_PIPELINE` in the binary).**
   The vDSO + `pthread_spin_lock` share did not move (6.9%). The
   callers are `now_us()` and the spin at `efs_rdma_send_frame`
   lines ~1257–1301: after `post_send` the sender **waits for its own
   send CQE** (spin 200 µs, then `sched_yield` until `send_busy[idx]`
   clears). More pool buffers cannot help; each PUT fragment still costs
   the thread one HCA round trip before it can post the next. The
   comment says the wait exists so a failed first SEND after upgrade
   surfaces as EIO instead of hanging in recv. On the 22:48 single-`dd`
   profile the vDSO share was 0.8%, so the wait costs CPU mainly when
   several writers share one QP; the gate below still applies to the
   seven-`dd` shape. Fixed implementation:
   post and return; reap send CQEs where they are already reaped
   (`send_buf_pick` on the next send, and in the reply wait —
   `efs_rdma_recv_wait` / `efs_rdma_reply_ready*` call `reap_sends`
   before blocking, and a send CQE with an error status marks
   `rc->broken` and makes the pending reply wait return `EFS_ERR_NET`).
   That preserves the "failed send becomes EIO on the reply path"
   property without a synchronous wait. Keep the 5 s
   `EFS_RDMA_SEND_WAIT_US` as the reply-wait's dead-QP bound. Gate:
   vDSO + `pthread_spin_lock` under 1% on the dd profile;
   `tests/test_rdma_xprt` and `tests/rdma_first_inode.sh` pass
   (the first-SEND-after-upgrade case is the one the wait was added
   for); 9-client dd not worse than 2551.5.
5. **The last user-space copy: let the kernel fill the dcache buffer.**

   **Checked Sep 29 15:33Z on fstor007 (`~/efs-runs/rec-splice1.log`):
   cannot take effect on this cluster as configured.** libfuse
   3.10.2's `fuse_session_receive_buf_int` uses the pipe only if it
   can grow it to `se->bufsize` = `max_write` + 4 KiB; `efs_fuse_init`
   sets `max_write` to `EFS_WRITE_PIPELINE × cs` = 4 MiB, and
   `/proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size` is 1048576, so `F_SETPIPE_SZ` fails
   for a non-root process and libfuse falls back to the buffer path
   for good (`can_grow = 0`). **Resolved 15:45Z: the user set
   `fs.pipe-max-size=8388608` on node9901, fstor007, fcstor003–015
   (`sysctl -w`, runtime only — it reverts on reboot like
   `ptrace_scope`; ask the user to re-apply, do not edit
   `/etc/sysctl.d`).** `efs_fuse_init` now sets `FUSE_CAP_SPLICE_READ`
   when libfuse offers it. Rolled 16:09Z on the servers; clients are
   not mounted, so this is not gated. The gate
   below stands; the `fuse_copy_page` share is the number to compare.
   Lowering `max_write` under 1 MiB was the other route and was not
   taken (every `dd bs=1M` write would become two requests).

   After step 3 (verified 22:48: `ll_write_buf` `memmove` gone) every
   written byte is still copied twice: kernel → libfuse request buffer
   (`fuse_copy_page`/`memcpy_erms`, ~7% + 2.5% kernel) and libfuse
   buffer → dcache (`fuse_buf_copy`, ~22% user, caller-less in perf
   because libfuse has no frame pointers). libfuse 3 can receive a
   write's payload through a pipe instead of its buffer
   (`FUSE_CAP_SPLICE_READ`; `fuse_session_receive_buf` marks the
   payload `FUSE_BUF_IS_FD`), and `fuse_buf_copy` from an fd buffer
   into a memory buffer is one `read()` from the pipe into the
   destination — the dcache buffer step 3 already allocates. Net: one
   kernel copy per byte, none in user space. Do this as its own
   change: in `efs_fuse_init` set `conn->want |= FUSE_CAP_SPLICE_READ`
   when `conn->capable` has it; keep `FUSE_BUF_NO_SPLICE` on the
   `fuse_buf_copy` calls (it only forbids `splice()` for fd→fd, which
   we never do). Verify first, on fstor007, three things libfuse
   3.10.2 decides at runtime: that a 1 MiB write is actually delivered
   as an fd buffer (libfuse copies small requests to memory; check the
   threshold in `fuse_session_receive_buf_int`), that the pipe can hold
   `max_write` + header (`F_SETPIPE_SZ` vs `/proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size`,
   1 MiB default — if the cap is below `max_write` + 4 KiB the request
   falls back to the buffer path and nothing changes), and that the
   `write_buf` path is the only consumer (`efs_fuse_write` with a plain
   pointer must not be reachable for fd buffers). Gate: on the 1-client

**Historical record (dated).** Evidence and steps as they were written at the time. A step marked *done* or *superseded* in the status block above is not to be executed; its text stays so the gate directories and the reasoning remain findable.

**Source (Sep 28 2026, ~18:30 EDT).** fstor007-mgmt mounted 19810 with
`client.sh --perf` while the 9×4 IOR was writing. Mount succeeded
(`fuse serving`, RDMA up). `df -h /tmp/efs-mount/` printed
`No such file or directory`. The fuse log has one line for it:
`inode-rpc: shard=0 type=47 exhausted 16 BUSY/STALE retries (10.3 s) -> EBUSY`.
Type 47 is `EFS_MSG_INODE_GETATTR`; shard 0 is the root's shard (even →
group 2). The mount was alive; `client.sh stop` unmounted cleanly. Same
class as the `INODE_LOOKUP` on shard 3745 that aborted IOR's `stat` in the
22:00Z run (handoff archive, [../project-history.md](../project-history.md)). Not data loss, not a dead mount, not RDMA.

Two defects, one visible and one underneath:

1. **Error mapping.** `efs_client_stat_ino` and `efs_client_stat_refresh`
   (`src/client/ops.c`) return `EFS_ERR_NOT_FOUND` for *any* RPC failure;
   `ll_getattr` (`src/client/efs_fuse.c`) maps every non-ACCES failure to
   `-ENOENT`. An overloaded cluster therefore looks like a missing
   directory to `df`, `ls`, and every path walk. The comment above the
   `no-hint` retry in `rpc_send_recv_shard` already names this.
2. **The read starves.** A GETATTR is a linearizable read:
   `host_read_index` records `commit` on arrival and waits for a read
   round and `applied ≥ read_index`; `host_wait_applied` has the same
   budget. Both give up after `HOST_READ_TRIES × HOST_TICK_US` = 400 ms
   with BUSY (`obs_wait_timeouts` counts it). The client
   (`rpc_send_recv_shard`) retries 16 times with `50 ms << min(attempt,4)`
   backoff, ~10.35 s total, then returns `EFS_ERR_BUSY`. So the observed
   line means group 2 could not satisfy a read for ten seconds straight:
   either `applied` trailed `commit` by more than 400 ms the whole time
   (36 ranks publishing; REPORT/publish applies on the pump; L1 pressure
   from this same IOR is recorded in the handoff archive, [../project-history.md](../project-history.md)), or group 2 was re-electing
   (a hintless NOT_PRIMARY lands in the same BUSY/STALE bucket). A fresh
   client is the victim because its first op is the root GETATTR and it
   has no cached row; the IOR ranks mostly write and read their own
   dcache.

Steps, in this order:

1. **Fix the mapping first (client, small).** Carry the RPC rc out of
   `efs_client_stat_ino` / `efs_client_stat_refresh` (return it, do not
   fold to NOT_FOUND). In `ll_getattr` and the `lookup_fill` path map
   `EFS_ERR_BUSY` and `EFS_ERR_NOT_PRIMARY` to `-EBUSY` (rmdir/unlink
   already use EBUSY for `EFS_ERR_BUSY`), `EFS_ERR_NET`/`EFS_ERR_IO` to
   `-EIO`, and only a real `EFS_INODE_RPC_NOT_FOUND` to `-ENOENT`. Grep
   every caller of both functions (there are ~10 in `efs_fuse.c`) —
   some legitimately treat "cannot read parent" as ENOENT for a *child*
   lookup; those need the same split. Gate: posix 1 jobs=1 200/201,
   posix 2 63/63, and a forced 10 s BUSY (step 2's repro) makes `stat`
   return EBUSY, never ENOENT. If the user prefers EIO over EBUSY for
   stat, that is a one-line choice; ask before choosing EIO.
2. **Reproduce and attribute, then decide which server fix applies.**
   Script under `tests/measure/` (runbook in runbooks.md): start the 9×4
   IOR (`run.sh debug`), mount a 10th client on node9901 or fstor007
   (TCP or RDMA, whichever the cluster runs), and once a second run
   `stat /tmp/efs-mount/` recording errno + wall, while sampling
   `efs-mgmt raft-status` (`commit − applied`, `leader`, `term` per
   group) and grepping the leaders' `efsd.log` for
   `raft-host: read-sleep` / `apply-sleep us=` and `raft-obs`
   `obs_wait_timeouts`. Outcome A: `commit − applied` on group 2 stays
   above what 400 ms of apply covers for the whole IOR → the read is the
   messenger and the fix is apply throughput (W14 step 1 plus the cost of
   publish/REPORT apply under load; measure `apply_max` and per-cycle
   apply count first). Outcome B: term changes line up with the BUSY
   window → it is the W14 step 2 election trigger. Outcome C: lag is
   bursty (compaction/flush stalls of ≥ 400 ms) → it is L1/L0 pressure
   (W13's follow-on, closed), not the read path. Record which; do not
   guess.
3. **Only after step 2:** if the lag is steady-state and apply throughput
   cannot close it, bring the trade-off to the user: readers currently
   wait for `applied ≥ commit-at-arrival`, which is the linearizable
   contract; a read that gives up after 400 ms and a client that gives
   up after 10 s are policy numbers the spec does not set. Do not change
   either number on your own.

**Step 2 outcome, first sample (Sep 28 22:11–22:19 EDT, no script yet).**
Seven parallel `dd bs=1M` from fstor007 into new files in one directory;
one `dd` got `open: Device or resource busy` (step 1's mapping is in
the binary, so this is the same failure that printed ENOENT before).
The fuse log for that mount holds **249** `exhausted 16 BUSY/STALE`
lines: LOOKUP 98, SETATTR 50, GETATTR 47, RENAME 31, CREATE 23. Every
`inode-rpc: retry … why=no-hint` line is a NOT_PRIMARY with no leader
hint. `raft-status`: group 0 term 9368 (was 9309 at 00:39Z), group 2
term 2789 (was 2763), both `commit == applied` when sampled;
fcstor004 `raft-obs`: `wait_timeouts=366`, `apply_max=30us`,
`apply-sleep` up to 57 ms on single entries, and the outbox
`drop=72114 > sent=50695` to the group 2 leader. **That is Outcome B:
elections, not apply lag.** The fix is W14 step 2 (a)–(c); W16 step 3's
policy question does not arise until W14 step 2 is done and this is
re-sampled with the script. Still write the script: it is the gate.

**Sep 29 02:35Z re-sample, and D8 (decided).** With W14 step 2 (a)–(b)
rolled, `drop=0` on every outbox and the terms still moved (+45 /
+105) — the trigger is the InstallSnapshot import (W22, D5). The
write-side wait now has a number: `report-split nrec=86234
pack_ms=1431 push_ms=9869 finish_ms=9227` — 337 publish batches at
~29 ms each through the one in-flight batch. **D8:** before any
read/wait policy or budget question, add `pub_batch_ms` (p50 / max
per group, the time from a batch's propose to its apply) to
`raft-obs`, run one 9-client `run.sh ior` after W22 steps 1–2 are
rolled, and bring the number: ~2–6 ms per batch means the 29 ms is
queueing behind the other eight clients' batches and the lever is
fewer, larger entries per REPORT (a wire question — ask); ~100 ms
means the `fsync` mode and D6 is the lever. Pipelining past one
in-flight batch stays forbidden. Order-table row 10.

- **Gate:** step 1's mapping gate; step 2's script committed with one
  attributed run in `results/measure/`; START-HERE §1b updated with the outcome.
- **Forbidden:** raising `HOST_READ_TRIES`, `HOST_TICK_US`, or the
  16-attempt client budget to make the symptom go away; serving a
  GETATTR from the follower's or client's local state without the read
  round (that is the linearizability I2/I10 guarantee); touching
  `entry/attr_timeout`; clearing `FOPEN_DIRECT_IO`.

#### W17 — Nine writers on one file: publish STALE storm, fsync EIO, and a FUSE request that outlives its process

> **Current status (Oct 2 2026; a document claim — the cited gate directory is the evidence):** PARTIAL. Step 1 (a FUSE request returns): D24's landed-PUT REPORTs and the record-sized REPORT wait removed the 20-minute class; the unconverging STALE loop itself is now **D27** (stalled publication: stop, retain, sticky EIO, refuse clean teardown). Step 3 (D1 span publish) is in the tree per the Sep 30 IO-500 (36-rank hard-write 0.640 GiB/s, 0 errors). Open residuals: **W38** (a fold tombstone without the span's bytes, plan row 4) and **W41** (`report_mu`, decided, plan row C). Step 2's per-chunk attribution counters are not recorded as landed.
>
> **Remaining action:** W38, then W41, in the START-HERE order; implement D27 under 0a.
>
> **Governing decision:** D1, D24, D27, W41 (decided). **Fold actors, precisely:** a fold may be performed only by (a) the publisher whose span fills the last delta slot, inside that publish, or (b) a reader that observes a full chain, as a background PUT off the read path that never blocks the read. No other rank's `fsync`/`close` folds; no fold on a chain that is not full; a fold's observation must come from a body that holds every span it folds (W38).

**Historical record (dated).** Evidence and steps as they were written at the time. A step marked *done* or *superseded* in the status block above is not to be executed; its text stays so the gate directories and the reasoning remain findable.

**Source (Sep 28 2026, 22:14–22:56Z, `bbcbcb5`).** ior-hard, 9 ranks,
one file (ino 1166063), 47008-byte records, `run.sh ior`. Evidence:

- fcstor004 `efsd.log`: a run of `raft-host: apply publish rc=-14
  index=… ino=1166063 ci=…` with distinct chunk indexes (512867,
  617329, 566269, 856797, …). `-14` is `EFS_ERR_STALE`: the CAS base
  the client reported is no longer the published generation because
  another rank published that chunk in between.
- Every client `fuse.log`: `inode-rpc: retry type=67 … why=recv rc=-6`
  then `inode-rpc: dual type=67 exhausted 16 BUSY/STALE retries
  (10.3 s) -> EBUSY`, several times per client. Type 67 is
  `EFS_MSG_REPORT_CHUNKS`. The BUSY is the server's
  `host_wait_applied` 400 ms budget inside `host_pub_batch_wait`
  (group 2 apply lagging under nine clients' publish batches), and the
  STALE is `host_pub_batch_wait` reporting any STALE verdict for the
  batch.
- fcstor013: `efs-fuse fsync: resource busy (efs_rc=-13) ino=1166063`
  → `efs_fuse_fsync_ino` returns `-EIO`. IOR: `WARNING: fsync(19)
  failed` ×8, `ERROR: close(20) failed`, rank 8 `MPI_ABORT`.
- After the abort, `io500` on fcstor007–010 and 012–014 sat in
  D-state `request_wait_answer` for 20+ min (SIGKILLed, still waiting
  on a FUSE reply). The reply they wait for is a `flush`/`release`/
  `fsync` whose `efs_client_report_dirty_ino(ino, sync=1)` is still in
  its loop: up to 64 STALE rounds, each a `stale_repull_replay` (GET +
  PUT of every moved chunk) plus a REPORT that can itself take the full
  16-retry 10.3 s, and up to 8 BUSY rounds on top. The loop is bounded
  in code and unbounded in practice.

This is the W1 N-1 CAS shape (36-way sub-chunk CAS on Sep 21 gave
hard-write 0.046 GiB/s) with nine whole ranks instead of sub-chunk
writers. The 4-rank shared-file IOR passed on Sep 27 (481.56 MiB/s,
`results/posix2/20260927-190509`); nine did not.

What to implement, in this order:

1. **A FUSE request returns.** `efs_client_report_dirty_ino` with
   `sync=1` must have a wall-clock bound that is shorter than what the
   kernel will wait, and the bound must cover the whole loop (STALE
   rounds × REPORT retries × BUSY retries), not one leg. When the bound
   is hit, `fsync` returns EIO with the dirty set merged back (the data
   is not lost; the next fsync retries). Measure first: add a counter
   line at loop exit (`report-loop ino= rounds= stale= busy= ms= rc=`)
   and run ior-hard NP=9 once to record the distribution. Then bring the
   number to the user — the 64-round and 16-retry budgets are policy
   the spec does not set. Gate: after `pkill -9 -x io500` mid-ior-hard,
   `pgrep -x io500` is empty within that bound on all nine clients
   and `efs-fuse` is still serving (`stat` OK).
2. **Attribute the STALE per chunk.** Log, on the server, how many
   publishes of one `(ino, ci)` lost the CAS within one fsync window
   (`raft-obs` counter `pub_stale` per group is enough), and on the
   client how many bytes each `stale_repull_replay` re-PUT versus how
   many bytes it owned. If a 47 KB record costs a 128 KiB GET + PUT +
   re-REPORT per losing rank, that ratio is the number to show the user.
   The `delta_off`/`delta_len` fields in `efs_chunk_rec` exist for a
   sub-chunk span publish; check whether the replay path fills them or
   always re-publishes the whole chunk, and record which.
3. **Decided (D1, Sep 28): make the span publish commute.** Three
   changes, in `efs_meta_apply_publish` and `dcache_flush_slot_inner`:
   - **Server:** for `delta_len > 0`, drop the `expected_gen != committed
     → STALE` check; a span attaches to whatever base is current. Keep
     the check for full-image publishes (`delta_len == 0`), which still
     require the live delta list to match exactly. When a fold replaces
     the base, write the folded spans' `candidate_gen`s into the new
     trailer (≤ `EFS_CHUNK_DELTA_MAX` entries); a span whose
     `candidate_gen` is in that list is a replay → OK, no-op. Overlap
     with a live span stays STALE (the client re-pulls that span's
     bytes only). A full chain still returns STALE to the publisher,
     who folds — that publisher, not the others.
   - **Client:** a slot whose dirty ranges cover less than the chunk
     publishes a span **even when `have_base` is set**
     (`span_of` regardless of `have_base`); the full-image path is for
     `dcache_full_overwrite` and for the fold. `stale_repull_replay`
     on an overlap STALE re-pulls and re-publishes the overlapping span,
     not the chunk.
   - **Reader:** `efs_meta_apply_get_chunk_deltas` and the client's
     base+spans overlay are unchanged; a reader that sees a full chain
     may fold as a background PUT, off the read — the second of the
     two allowed fold actors (status block); it never delays the read.
   Gate: `test_meta_apply` gains "span after fold is OK",
   "replay of folded span is no-op", "overlapping span is STALE";
   `peer_shared_pwrite` and `concurrent_appends` pass; ior-hard NP=9
   and NP=36 SEGS=3000 cold verify bad 0 with `pub_stale` per fsync
   at 0 in steady state and the write rate rising from NP=4's 481.56
   MiB/s.

- **Gate:** step 1's bound + kill test; step 2's numbers in
  `results/measure/` with the script under `tests/measure/`; step 3's
  gate; ior-hard NP=4 SEGS=3000 cold verify still 12000 records bad 0;
  posix 1 jobs=1 200/201; posix 2 63/63.
- **Forbidden:** a distributed chunk lock; splitting REPORT into
  several RPCs; widening the 16-attempt RPC budget or `HOST_READ_TRIES`;
  making `fsync` return success on a merged-back (unpublished) dirty
  set; `hard_remove`; raising `EFS_CHUNK_DELTA_MAX` to avoid the fold;
  a fold by any actor other than the two named in the status block
  (the chain-filling publisher inside its publish; a reader as a
  background PUT off the read path); a fold that blocks a read; a
  fold whose observation does not hold every span it folds (W38).

#### W18 — Client: the dcache reclaim is a table walk, and it is most of the client's CPU under a long write

> **Current status (Oct 2 2026; a document claim — the cited gate directory is the evidence):** DONE by document claim: reclaim pops per-shard dirty lists, `dcache_init` once, `dirty ⟹ on_dirty` (`b6c1712d`, Sep 30/Oct 1); the `g_reclaim` herd fix (Oct 1) is the follow-on.
>
> **Remaining action:** none.
>
> **Governing decision:** none.
>
> **Gate:** `dcache_flush_slot_inner` self under 5 % and no `dcache_reclaim_main` scan at the top of a client profile during an 8 GiB dd.

**Historical record (dated).** Evidence and steps as they were written at the time. A step marked *done* or *superseded* in the status block above is not to be executed; its text stays so the gate directories and the reasoning remain findable.

**Source (Sep 28 2026, run 3, fcstor007 `efs-fuse`, 917K samples over
~40 min).** `by_thread.txt`: `dcache_flush_slot_inner` 43.8% **self**,
`pthread_once@GLIBC` 25.0% self, `pthread_mutex_lock` 8.3% +
`unlock` 3.5%, blake3 3.3%, `memmove` 2.4%. `callers.txt`:
`dcache_reclaim_main` is 73.5% of the process. The 5-minute profile
from run 2 (36K samples) had blake3 at 27% and this function's self
time under the floor; the long capture is the one that shows the
steady state.

Why it looks like this (`src/client/write.c`):

- `DCACHE_SLOTS` is 65536 hash buckets of chained `dcache_ent`;
  `DCACHE_RECLAIM_THREADS` is 16; each wake walks
  `DCACHE_RECLAIM_SCAN` = 64 slots via a shared cursor and, in
  `dcache_flush_slot_inner`, walks each slot's whole chain under the
  shard mutex skipping clean entries (`!e->dirty || !e->data`). With
  the staging table "over EFS_CLIENT_META_MB (256 MB) with nothing
  evictable; growing" (every client logged this), the chains are long
  and mostly clean. The self time is the chain walk.
- `dcache_mu()` and `dcache_io_mu()` call
  `pthread_once(&g_dcache_once, dcache_init)` on every call; the walk
  calls them per slot. 25% of the client is that check.
- 64 shard mutexes for 65536 slots, 16 walkers plus the FUSE write
  threads (`efs_dcache_try_patch`) on the same locks: the 12% in
  lock/unlock.

What to implement:

1. **Reclaim from a dirty list, not a table scan.** When an entry
   becomes dirty (`dcache_note_dirty_bytes(+len)` call sites), put it on
   a per-shard dirty list; reclaim pops from that list. A popped entry
   that is no longer dirty is skipped in O(1). The chain walk in
   `dcache_flush_slot_inner` stays only for `have_only=1` (close/fsync
   of one inode), which can also use a per-inode index if the profile
   still shows it. Gate: `dcache_flush_slot_inner` self under 5% and
   `dcache_reclaim_main` under 15% of a 30 s-stonewall easy-write
   profile; `dirty_bytes` accounting unchanged (posix 2 63/63;
   `concurrent_appends` and `peer_shared_pwrite` pass).
2. **Initialize the dcache once.** Call `dcache_init` from client
   startup (the export mount path) and drop the `pthread_once` from
   `dcache_mu` / `dcache_io_mu`. Gate: `pthread_once` gone from
   `flat.txt`.
3. **Re-measure W15 steps 1 and 3** on the same profile: `memmove` in
   `ll_write_buf` (7.5% in run 2) and in the RDMA send (6.3%). Those
   items stand; this one goes first because it is the larger share.

- **Gate:** the two profile gates; 9-client 8 GiB dd not worse than
  2551.5 MiB/s; 1-client dd not worse than 947 RDMA; posix 1 jobs=1
  200/201, posix 2 63/63.
- **Forbidden:** changing the 2 GiB reclaim limit or the 2× inline-help
  cap to hide the walk; dropping the `have_base` guard for reclaim
  (the `concurrent_appends` NULs); clearing `FOPEN_DIRECT_IO`.

#### W19 — Server: the Raft pump copies every AppendEntries twice, and `try_commit` re-walks the log per reply

> **Current status (Oct 2 2026; a document claim — the cited gate directory is the evidence):** UNVERIFIED — no roll record in START-HERE, the rules or project-history names W19 as landed. Treat as OPEN.
>
> **Remaining action:** re-profile one group leader (`perf record -g -p $(pgrep -x efsd)` during a 9-client dd); if `memmove` under the pump's AE path is under 2 % and `try_commit` under 1 %, close this item with the profile dir; otherwise steps 1–2 below as written.
>
> **Governing decision:** none needed (mechanical).
>
> **Gate:** the two profile shares above; both groups `commit == applied` with no term change during the measurement.

**Historical record (dated).** Evidence and steps as they were written at the time. A step marked *done* or *superseded* in the status block above is not to be executed; its text stays so the gate directories and the reasoning remain findable.

**Source (Sep 28 2026, run 3, fcstor003 = group 0 leader, 1M
samples).** `flat.txt`: `memmove` 18.5%, kernel `rep_movs_alternative`
17.0%, `try_commit` 4.0% self, `__d_lookup_rcu` 2.6%. `callers.txt`:

| share | stack |
| --- | --- |
| 12.6% | `host_pump` → `efs_raft_recv`/`efs_raft_flush` → `send_ae` → `host_send` → `memmove` |
| 5.2% | same → `send_ae` → `memmove` (the arena fill) |
| 6.9% | `host_sender` → `efs_conn_send_msg` → `writev` → `tcp_sendmsg` → `copyin` |
| 10.5% | `host_pump` → `efs_raft_recv` → `try_commit` (4.0% self, `log_term` → `disk_get` → mutex) |

On fcstor004 the receiving side is `server_handle_conn` → `recv` →
`copyout` 15.4%. The peer connections are TCP for frames above the
72 KiB RDMA buffer (`conn_pick_send_chan`), which is every catch-up
AppendEntries batch.

What the code does (`src/raft/raft.c`, `src/server/raft_host.c`):

- `send_ae` mallocs an `EFS_RAFT_AE_BYTES` arena and `store->get`s each
  entry into it (copy 1, `disk_get`). `host_send` encodes the message
  into a stack buffer or a heap buffer (copy 2) and, when the stack
  buffer sufficed, `malloc`+`memcpy`s it again (copy 3) before queueing
  it for `host_sender`, which `writev`s it (kernel copy 4). All but the
  last run on the pump thread, under whatever the pump holds.
- `try_commit` runs on every AE reply and walks `n = last_i` down to
  `commit_index`, calling `log_term` (a `disk_get` under the store
  mutex) for each `n`, until it finds a quorum. When a follower is
  behind, `last_i − commit_index` is large and the walk repeats per
  reply.

What to implement:

1. **One user-space copy per AppendEntries.** Encode the wire frame
   directly into the buffer `host_sender` will write: `send_ae` asks
   `host_send` (or a new `net->alloc`) for a frame buffer sized from
   the entries' `clen`, fills header + entries in place, and hands
   ownership to the outbox. Drop the arena and the stack-then-heap
   re-copy. Gate: `memmove` under `host_send` + `send_ae` under 3% of
   the leader's profile during a 9-client write; `test_raft` OK.
2. **`try_commit` from the reply's match index.** The only index whose
   match changed is the replying peer's; a commit can only advance to
   an `n` in `(commit_index, match_index[from]]` whose term is current.
   Start the walk at `min(last_i, match_index[from])` and stop at the
   first quorum; cache the term of the highest entry so the common case
   is one `log_term`. Gate: `try_commit` self under 0.5%; `test_raft`
   commit/term tests OK; no change in `commit_index` sequence on a
   replayed unit log.
3. **Measure, do not change, the transport choice.** Record how many
   AE frames per second exceed 72 KiB and their size distribution
   (`raft-obs` line). `EFS_RAFT_AE_BYTES` and the RDMA buffer size are
   not to be tuned here; if the numbers say the peer path should ride
   RDMA with a different framing, that is a design question for the
   user.

- **Gate:** the two profile gates; both groups commit==applied and no
  term change during a 9-client 8 GiB dd; posix 1 9-host not worse
  than `results/posix/20260928-034049`.
- **Forbidden:** changing `EFS_RAFT_AE_BYTES`, `EFS_RAFT_AE_MAX`,
  `HOST_PUB_BATCH_N`, `HOST_TICK_US`, or the heartbeat/election
  timeouts; taking `h->mu` in `host_sender`; pipelining more than the
  one in-flight batch per behind peer.

#### W20 — Client: `stat` is O(chunks) — `st_blocks` walks every chunk of the file under two locks

> **Current status (Oct 2 2026; a document claim — the cited gate directory is the evidence):** steps 1–2 DONE (Sep 29, `present_chunks`/`present_extra`, `ll_setattr` reads `size` from the row). The residual — `st_blocks` is 0 for files this client did not write — is **D17, decided Oct 2** (per-lane present-chunk count in the lane stamp), plan row E.
>
> **Remaining action:** D17 per its row in START-HERE.
>
> **Governing decision:** D17.
>
> **Gate:** `stat` of a 16 GiB file under 1 ms idle; after D17, `du` of a file written by another client ≈ size/512.

**Historical record (dated).** Evidence and steps as they were written at the time. A step marked *done* or *superseded* in the status block above is not to be executed; its text stays so the gate directories and the reasoning remain findable.

**Status (Sep 29, in tree, not measured).** `efs_inode_mem` keeps
`present_chunks` (table inserts and removals) and `present_extra`
(a dirty dcache slot that is not in the table). `st_blocks` reads
that sum and probes only a partial tail. `ll_setattr` reads `size`
from the row.

**Source (Sep 28 2026, 20:36–20:39 EDT, fstor007 `client.sh --perf`,
214K samples, `~/orcd/scratch/efs/perf/efs-mount/callers.txt`).**
`ll_setattr` 8.9% of the process, all of it
`efs_fuse_getattr_ino` → `fill_stat_from_inode` → `inode_allocated_bytes`
(`src/client/efs_fuse.c`). Inside that: `efs_dcache_has` 3.7% self,
`pthread_mutex_lock`/`unlock` 2.5%, `__lll_lock_wait` 2.0% (the futex
sleeps under `fill_stat_from_inode` are 1.4% of the kernel time; the
flush path holds `idx_mu` and the dcache shard mutexes).

Why: `inode_allocated_bytes` computes `st_blocks` as "present chunks,
not holes" by looping `ci = 0 .. size/128 KiB` and, per chunk, taking
`efs_client_lock_dir` + `idx_mu` for `efs_export_get_chunk`, then the
dcache shard mutex for `efs_dcache_has`. A 16 GiB IOR file is 131072
chunks, so one `stat` is 262144 lock/unlock pairs and hash probes, and
`ll_setattr` calls `efs_fuse_getattr_ino` **twice** (before, for
`old_size`; after, for the reply). `ls -l`, `du`, `cp -p`/`ecopy`
(utimes + chmod after each file), IOR's `stat`, and every `getattr`
the kernel issues with `attr_timeout=0` pay this per file. It was ~0%
when added (project-history: small files) and is now a scaling bug by
the §1 rule: `stat` cost grows with file size.

What to implement:

1. **Make `st_blocks` O(1).** Keep a per-inode "present bytes" (or
   present-chunk count) in the staged inode row, maintained where chunks
   are inserted/removed in the client table (`efs_export_*chunk*` add /
   remove / truncate) and where the dcache admits a dirty chunk that is
   not yet in the table (`dcache_note_dirty_bytes` call sites already
   count bytes per entry). `inode_allocated_bytes` reads that counter.
   Holes stay holes: a chunk that is neither in the table nor dirty in
   the dcache is not counted, same as today.
2. **`ll_setattr` asks for `old_size` from the row, not a full
   `getattr`.** Only `FUSE_SET_ATTR_SIZE` needs the old size, and it
   needs `size`, not `st_blocks`.
3. **Gate:** a `stat` of a 16 GiB file on an idle mount under 1 ms
   (measure with `tests/measure/md_latency.py`'s stat row on a large
   file, add that row); `ll_setattr`/`fill_stat_from_inode` under 0.5%
   in the W15 re-profile; `st_blocks` unchanged for the posix suite
   (`size_and_mtime`, sparse and truncate tests) — posix 1 jobs=1
   200/201, posix 2 63/63.

- **Forbidden:** reporting `st_blocks` from `size` alone (sparse files
  and truncate stubs must still show holes); touching
  `entry/attr_timeout`; caching a stale `st_blocks` across a peer's
  REPORT (the counter is updated when the table adopts chunks, not
  time-based).

#### W21 — Client: the staging evictor recomputes the table size up to 1024 times per second and evicts nothing

> **Current status (Oct 2 2026; a document claim — the cited gate directory is the evidence):** DONE by document claim: steps 1–2 rolled Sep 29; the Sep 30 targeted-evict fix; D18 (cold-tab eviction) Oct 1.
>
> **Remaining action:** none.
>
> **Governing decision:** D18.
>
> **Gate:** two consecutive `du` runs with 0 syscalls over 10 ms in a client strace; `test_stage_evict`.

**Historical record (dated).** Evidence and steps as they were written at the time. A step marked *done* or *superseded* in the status block above is not to be executed; its text stays so the gate directories and the reasoning remain findable.

**Status (Sep 29 16:09Z, steps 1 and 2 rolled with the servers,
not measured; clients are not mounted).** Step 1: a wake that evicts nothing while over the cap
sets a 1 s idle deadline that `stage_evict_kick` honours; an unpin
clears it. Step 2: `efs_export_staged_bytes` returns the root's
`staged_total`, a running sum of every table's `staged_est`;
`staged_refresh` re-derives one table's estimate wherever a capacity
or arena changes (slab and name arenas via `staged_slab_add`, the
slab directory, chunk array growth and shrink, the ino/name/chunk/icnt
index rebuilds, the child index and vectors, `compact_one_tab`, tab
attach and free). `test_stage_evict` checks the total across a
compaction. Step 3 stays behind a measurement. The earlier in-tree
state, for the record: one `efs_export_staged_bytes` per wake, a
wake walks at most four oldest bands, a fully pinned band advances a
cursor for the next wake instead of looping 1024 times.

**Re-review on the 22:48–22:55 profile (single `dd bs=1M`, 260K
samples).** `efs_export_staged_bytes` **7.4% self** and
`stage_evict_main` **5.4% self** (the inlined LRU scan in
`evict_pass`) — 12.8% of the client, more than before. The per-wake
cap works; the wake *rate* is the problem. `efs_client_stage_evict_kick`
is called from the staging paths on every write and is gated only on
`g_stage_bytes_seen > cap`. Once the table is over the cap with every
entry pinned (the "growing" state every writer reaches), that gate is
permanently true, so each 1 MiB write kicks the evictor, which wakes,
walks up to 4096 `shard_tabs` in `efs_export_staged_bytes`, scans the
LRU array up to four times, evicts nothing, goes back to
`pthread_cond_timedwait`, and is kicked again by the next write. The
1 s timer never gets to run because the kicks arrive faster.

Fixed implementation (replaces steps 1–2 above):

1. **A kick must not wake a scan that cannot evict.** Keep a
   `g_evict_idle_until` (monotonic) set to now + 1 s whenever a wake
   ends with `bytes > cap && evicted_total == 0`; `stage_evict_kick`
   returns without signalling while now < that deadline. Clear the
   deadline (set 0) where an entry becomes evictable — the unpin paths
   (`efs_client_stage_unpin`, last close, dcache clean-and-unpinned
   transitions) — so a real opportunity wakes the evictor at once.
   Gate: with one writer over cap, the evictor wakes at most once per
   second (count wakes in `EFS_STAGE_DBG` output).
2. **`efs_export_staged_bytes` in O(1).** Maintain one cross-tab
   running total in the root export, updated by `staged_slab_add` and
   the child/name-arena accounting where each tab's counters change
   (they already update per-tab totals); the shard-tab loop goes.
   `efs_fuse.c:5047` (the mount log line) reads the same total.
   Gate: `efs_export_staged_bytes` under 0.2% on any profile.
3. **The LRU scan is the remaining cost per real wake** (5.4% here
   because of the wake rate; with step 1 it is 1 scan/s). If it still
   shows above 0.5% after step 1, keep the LRU in tick order (a
   min-heap or a circular array indexed by tick) so "the 256 oldest
   above a cursor" is a slice, not a pass over `g_lru_mask + 1` slots.
   Do not do this before measuring after step 1.
4. **Gate:** as below, plus `stage_evict_main` self + children under
   0.5% on a 1-client `dd bs=1M` profile with the table over cap.

**Source (same profile as W20).** `efs_export_staged_bytes` 6.6%
**self**, caller `stage_evict_main` (`src/client/stage_evict.c`).
`stage_evict_main` itself 2.4%. W15's table said this was "replaced by a
running total Sep 28"; it was not. `export_staged_bytes_one` reads
running totals for one tab, but `efs_export_staged_bytes` still loops
`s = 1 .. shard_tab_cap` over `shard_tabs` (up to 4096) per call, and
`evict_pass` calls it once per pass.

Why the call count: when `bytes > cap` and the SCAN_BATCH (256) oldest
LRU entries are all pinned, `evict_pass` returns `evicted=0,
band_full=1`; `stage_evict_main` sets `min_tick = band_max` and loops,
up to 1024 rounds per wake, each round recomputing staged bytes and
scanning the **whole** LRU array (`for i in 0..g_lru_mask`) to find the
next 256 candidates. Every client logged "staging table over
EFS_CLIENT_META_MB (256 MB) with nothing evictable; growing" during the
IOR, so this is the steady state under a write flood: O(rounds × (tabs
+ LRU)) per second, no eviction, on a core the writers wanted.

What to implement:

1. **One `staged_bytes` per wake.** Compute it once in
   `stage_evict_main` before the round loop and adjust by what each
   round actually freed (`evict_pass` knows the bytes it dropped), or
   keep a true running total across tabs (`staged_slab_add` already
   exists per tab; add the cross-tab sum there). Gate:
   `efs_export_staged_bytes` under 0.5% in the W15 re-profile.
2. **Stop the pinned-band loop from rescanning the LRU.** Walk the LRU
   once per wake in tick order (or keep it ordered) so advancing past a
   pinned band is a cursor move, not a fresh O(N) scan. If the whole
   table is pinned, log the "growing" line once (already done) and
   sleep until the next kick or 1 s — do not spend 1024 rounds proving
   it. Gate: `stage_evict_main` + children under 1% while a client is
   over cap with all entries pinned (the IOR steady state).
3. **Gate:** W9's RSS result still holds (cold stat of 1M files levels
   near 233 MB, `results/measure/20260927-w9-walk`); posix 1 jobs=1
   200/201; posix 2 63/63.

- **Forbidden:** raising `EFS_CLIENT_META_MB` to hide it; evicting
  pinned (dirty or open) inodes; changing the 1 s wake period to
  something longer so the walk is merely rarer.

#### W49 — Client: five liveness syscalls per connection checkout, plus an `fstat` per send (was "W23"; renamed Oct 2 — W23 is the server compaction item)

> **Current status (Oct 2 2026; a document claim — the cited gate directory is the evidence):** UNVERIFIED — no roll record names this item (renamed from the duplicate "W23" on Oct 2; the server item keeps W23). Treat as OPEN, low priority.
>
> **Remaining action:** attach `strace -c -f -p $(pgrep -x efs-fuse)` for 10 s during an `ecopy`; if `fstat` + `getsockopt` + `recvfrom(MSG_PEEK)` are under 1 % of syscalls, close with the count; otherwise steps 1–2 below.
>
> **Governing decision:** none needed (mechanical).

**Historical record (dated).** Evidence and steps as they were written at the time. A step marked *done* or *superseded* in the status block above is not to be executed; its text stays so the gate directories and the reasoning remain findable.

**Source (Sep 29 2026 00:18–00:22 EDT, `client.sh --perf --strace` on
fstor007, `~/orcd/scratch/efs/perf/efs-mount/strace-summary.txt`,
230 s window, `ecopy --verify` + one `dd`).** Syscall counts:
`fstat` 1 171 561, `getsockopt` 1 172 007 (586 035 `SO_ERROR`,
585 972 `TCP_INFO`), `recvfrom` 598 781 (all `MSG_PEEK`), `poll`
1 121 932, `read` 1 195 618 (297K on the FUSE fd, the rest eventfds and
sockets), `write` 583 579 (`recv_poller` eventfd wakes). In the
untraced 22:11 profile the same path was `__fstat64` 1.2% +
`__getsockopt` 1.2% + `efs_client_conn_get` 0.6%; under ptrace it is
`efs_client_conn_get` 5% and `raft_voter_conn` 8%.

Why: `efs_client_conn_get` (`src/client/node_cache.c`) calls
`conn_fd_is_dead` on **every** checkout: `efs_conn_fd_matches` (an
`fstat`), `getsockopt(TCP_INFO)`, `poll(0)`, `recv(MSG_PEEK)`,
`getsockopt(SO_ERROR)`. Then `efs_conn_send_msg_parts`
(`src/common/protocol.c`) does `efs_conn_fd_matches` again before the
RDMA send. Six syscalls per checkout, three checkouts per chunk PUT,
one per metadata RPC — ~586K checkouts in this window, ~15K
syscalls/s. The probe exists for a real reason (the comment: a pooled
fd in CLOSE-WAIT after a peer FIN looked like a live checkout and every
PUT then failed; IPoIB CLOSE-WAIT sometimes reports no POLLIN/HUP), and
`fd_matches` exists because a recycled fd number once sent into a dead
QP. Neither reason needs a probe per checkout.

What to implement:

1. **Pool generation instead of `fstat`.** The pool is the only closer
   of pool fds. Give each slot a `gen` that `efs_client_conn_drop` /
   destroy bumps, store it in `struct efs_conn` at checkout, and make
   `efs_conn_fd_matches` compare integers. Keep the `fstat` form only
   for conns not owned by the pool (server side, tests) behind the
   existing `fd_id_ok` flag. Gate: `fstat` count in an
   `EFS_STRACE_EXPR='trace=fstat'` summary under 1% of the PUT count.
2. **Probe once per idle period.** Record `last_ok_ms` on a conn at
   every successful send/recv. In `efs_client_conn_get`, run
   `conn_fd_is_dead` only when `now - last_ok_ms > 1000` (the CLOSE-WAIT
   case is a conn that sat idle while the peer went away; a conn that
   completed an RPC a few milliseconds ago is not in CLOSE-WAIT). A
   checkout that skipped the probe and then fails in send/recv already
   drops the conn and marks the node (`efs_client_conn_drop`,
   `note_fail`); that path stays. Gate: `getsockopt` + `recvfrom(MSG_PEEK)`
   under 1% of the PUT count on the same summary; the Sep 20 CLOSE-WAIT
   repro (bounce one `efsd` while a client is idle for 30 s, then write)
   still recovers without an EIO.
3. **Gate:** posix 1 jobs=1 200/201, posix 2 63/63, 9-client dd not
   worse than 2551.5; `efs_client_conn_get` + `__fstat64` +
   `__getsockopt` together under 0.5% of an untraced dd profile.

- **Forbidden:** removing the dead-conn detection (the probe's reasons
  are real); probing on a timer thread (it would need the pool lock the
  hot path uses); changing `EFS_NODE_DOWN_FAILS` / `EFS_NODE_DOWN_MS`.

#### W24 — Client: `open(O_TRUNC)` of a large existing file did not return; SETATTR is the most-exhausted RPC

> **Current status (Oct 2 2026; a document claim — the cited gate directory is the evidence):** SUPERSEDED by W43 / D25 (plan rows 1, 3, A): the truncate path's silent NOMEM was the idle-cluster half of this symptom; W43 b made it an honest EIO, D25 (decided) makes it complete. The BUSY→EBUSY mapping is W16's.
>
> **Remaining action:** none under this number; D25 under W43.
>
> **Governing decision:** D25.
>
> **Gate:** `tests/stress/truncate_big.sh` exit 0 with gates t1–t9 (retained prefix, zero tail after re-extension, no stale beyond the fence, sweep vs new-epoch writes, restart mid-sweep, apply bound, **durable truncation history across repeated shrink/extend/partial-rewrite**, history bound, boundary rewrites); a loaded `open(O_TRUNC)` of a 10 GiB file returns within the SETATTR budget.

**Historical record (dated).** Evidence and steps as they were written at the time. A step marked *done* or *superseded* in the status block above is not to be executed; its text stays so the gate directories and the reasoning remain findable.

**Source (same window).** `dd.trace.txt`:
`openat(AT_FDCWD, "/tmp/efs-mount/001/dat08", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = ?`
followed by `+++ killed by SIGKILL +++` — the create-with-truncate of
the 1.7 GB file the previous `dd` had left never returned before the
user killed it. The fuse log's `exhausted 16 BUSY/STALE` count by type
went from 50 → **136** for SETATTR (type 63) between 22:19 and 00:27,
the largest of any type (RENAME 106, LOOKUP 98, GETATTR 47, CREATE
37). `clock_nanosleep`: 564 sleeps of 0.8 s in 230 s — the tail of
the BUSY backoff — plus `report-loop … busy=1 ms=8435..24182 rc=-13`
lines.

Why an `open` can outlive every budget in the tree:

- Kernel `open(O_TRUNC)` on an existing inode becomes FUSE `setattr(size)`
  → `efs_fuse_truncate_ino` (`src/client/efs_fuse.c`) →
  `efs_dcache_flush_ino` (flush every dirty chunk of the ino; each PUT
  waits on the writer pool), then `efs_client_truncate`
  (`src/client/ops.c`) → `efs_client_report_dirty_ino` (a REPORT loop
  — `report-loop … ms=24182` is one of those), then the SETATTR RPC,
  then `ll_setattr`'s getattr. Three to four RPC chains in sequence.
- Each chain is 16 attempts, but an attempt is bounded by the socket
  `EFS_IO_TIMEOUT_MS` = **30 s**, not by the 400 ms server read
  deadline: when the server holds the RPC (a REPORT was measured
  holding 20.5 s in W22's source; `host_truncate` in `raft_host.c`
  does a `host_read_index`, then proposes a LANE_FENCE per cross-group
  lane, then the truncate entry, each a commit wait), one chain can be
  minutes. The 10.3 s figure in the log line is the sum of the sleeps,
  not the wall.
- With W16 step 1 the final answer is EBUSY; the caller still waits
  through all of it first. The seven D-state `io500` processes in W17
  are the same shape seen from the other end.

What to implement:

1. **Measure one truncate, idle and loaded.** `truncate -s 0` of a
   2 GiB file on an idle cluster and under a 9-client write, with
   `strace -f -tt -T` on the fuse daemon filtered to that worker, and
   the `inode-rpc: slow-recv` / `report-loop` lines. Record per-RPC wall
   (`REPORT`, `SETATTR`, `GETATTR`) and the server-side
   `raft-host: setattr … rc=` pair. This says whether the time is the
   REPORT loop, the SETATTR's commit chain, or the retry sleeps.
   `results/measure/<stamp>-truncate-wall/`.
2. **Bound the whole operation, not each RPC.** `efs_fuse_truncate_ino`
   gets one deadline (the same 8 s W17 step 1 gave `fsync`, measured
   from entry); `efs_dcache_flush_ino`, `efs_client_report_dirty_ino`,
   and the SETATTR RPC each receive the remaining budget and return
   `EFS_ERR_BUSY` when it is gone. `fuse_stat_errno` maps that to EBUSY
   (already). Do not retry a SETATTR whose reply was lost: the server's
   op-id window (I16) answers the replay. Gate: under a 9-client write,
   `truncate -s 0` of a 2 GiB file returns (EBUSY allowed) within 10 s;
   idle it completes in under 1 s; posix 1 `truncate*` and
   `peer_o_trunc_visible` unchanged.
3. **`host_truncate` should not need a read round for the size path.**
   The `host_read_index` at the top is what pays the 400 ms BUSY under
   election churn before the proposal even starts; the proposal itself
   is the linearization point. Check whether the pre-read is only
   fetching `row` for lane splitting; if so, read the row from the
   local KV without a read round and let the truncate entry's apply
   re-validate (it already CASes the tail). This is a server change; if
   the pre-read is load-bearing for a fence ordering, stop and say so.

- **Gate:** step 1's measurement committed; step 2's bounds; posix 1
  jobs=1 200/201 (the truncate tests), posix 2 63/63,
  `posix_persist` shrink/remount cases once they exist.
- **Forbidden:** lowering `EFS_IO_TIMEOUT_MS` to make the chain shorter
  (a slow server reply is not a dead peer); returning success for a
  truncate whose SETATTR did not commit; touching the 16-attempt budget
  (W16 forbids it).

#### W25 — `futimens` fails with EINVAL on any file with a lane in the other Raft group; atime loses its nanoseconds; `ftruncate` says EAGAIN where `stat` says EBUSY

> **Current status (Oct 2 2026; a document claim — the cited gate directory is the evidence):** DONE by document claim: `futimens` on multi-lane files no longer EINVALs and `atime_nsec`/`ctime_nsec` ride the staged row (Sep 30 ecopy review); the mtime-lost-at-close case was fixed Sep 30 (utimens flushes pending writeback first); BUSY mapping is W16's.
>
> **Remaining action:** none.
>
> **Governing decision:** none open.
>
> **Gate:** `ecopy --verify` on a multi-lane tree: 0 `futimens: Invalid argument`, 0 atime mismatches; `mtime_repro.py` rows print the set time.

**Historical record (dated).** Evidence and steps as they were written at the time. A step marked *done* or *superseded* in the status block above is not to be executed; its text stays so the gate directories and the reasoning remain findable.

**Source (Sep 29 2026 00:1x EDT, `ecopy --verify /data1/erbmi1/knouse/
→ /tmp/efs-mount/knouse/` and the `software/` copy, operator's
terminal).** Three error strings, thousands of times:

- `<path>: futimens: Invalid argument` — only on large files (R and boost
  tarballs, cuDNN `.a`/`.so`, a MATLAB tar).
- `ecopy: verification metadata mismatch: <path> (atime)` — only on small
  files (conda-meta `.json`, headers).
- `ftruncate: Resource temporarily unavailable` — during the same window
  in which the fuse log's SETATTR `exhausted` count went 50 → 136.

**Confirmed from `ecopy.strace.txt` (00:35 EDT, `strace -f`, 585
threads, 255 931 lines, the `software/` copy, ended by Ctrl-C).**
Non-ENOENT failures: `utimensat` EINVAL **40** (516 succeeded),
`ftruncate` EAGAIN **19** (43 succeeded), `fallocate` EOPNOTSUPP 62,
`copy_file_range` EXDEV 423; `pwrite64` 29 905 and `pread64` 4 635 with
**no short or failed call**, no `close` errors, no `fsync` at all
(ecopy does not call it). Every EINVAL `utimensat` is on an fd that had
just had `fallocate` → `ftruncate` to tens or hundreds of MB (e.g. fd 74:
`ftruncate(74, 104082560)` then `utimensat(74, …) = EINVAL`); every
successful `utimensat` is on a file that went through the small-file
`copy_file_range` fallback. That is the lane split below, seen from
userspace. **Consequence:** after `futimens: Invalid argument` and after
`ftruncate: Resource temporarily unavailable`, ecopy `close`s and
**`unlinkat`s the `.ecopy.tmp.*` file** (56 unlinks in the trace): each
of those files was *not copied*. On this tree that is every file larger
than a few MB. The `ftruncate` that failed for `fd 47`
(923 946 888 bytes) was issued at line 6 123 and returned at line
137 107 of the trace — it blocked for most of the run before failing
(W24's chain; no `-tt` in this trace, so no wall figure). The 303
`verification metadata mismatch` lines are all `(atime)` and all on
files whose `utimensat` succeeded, i.e. item 2. `fallocate`
EOPNOTSUPP and `copy_file_range` EXDEV are the kernel's answers for a
FUSE mount without those ops and a cross-device copy; ecopy falls back
correctly and they cost one syscall each — not defects, noted so nobody
chases them. **`posix_fallocate` returning `EINVAL` is the same gap,
seen through glibc (Oct 1).** `efs_ll_ops` has no `fallocate`; libfuse
replies `ENOSYS` and the kernel turns that into `EOPNOTSUPP` for the
`fallocate` syscall. glibc's `posix_fallocate` does not return that: on
`EOPNOTSUPP` it writes zeros itself, and it does **not** emulate
`EINVAL`. On an `O_DIRECT` fd the fallback `pwrite` is not 4 KiB-aligned,
so it returns `EINVAL` (`fuse_odirect_unaligned` does the same for an
application `O_DIRECT` write). A normal fd's `posix_fallocate(0, 4096)`
succeeds only because of that zero-fill — `opt_fallocate` PASS is not
the filesystem reserving blocks. There is no preallocation. A tool that
treats the `EINVAL` as fatal writes nothing. **Implement the handler:
W26.**

Each is a code path, read from the tree, not from a profile:

1. **EINVAL on `futimens` = cross-group lanes.** `host_utimens`
   (`src/server/raft_host.c` ~9100): when the mask has MTIME it walks
   `row.active_lanes` and, for every lane whose shard is in the other
   Raft group, sets `rc = EFS_ERR_INVAL` with the comment
   `/* cross-group lane fence later */`. Lane shards straddle both
   groups (every odd lane of an inode is in the other group, project
   state), so any file that has written into two or more lanes — any
   file past the first few chunks — cannot have its mtime set.
   `efs_rc_to_errno` turns that into EINVAL. Small files (one lane, or
   all lanes in the row's group) work, which is exactly the split in the
   ecopy output. `host_truncate` already handles the same case (it
   proposes a LANE_FENCE per cross-group lane, then the entry);
   `host_utimens` was left as a stub.
2. **atime mismatch = seconds only.** `efs_fuse_utimens_ino`
   (`src/client/efs_fuse.c` 3228) keeps `tv[0].tv_sec` and drops
   `tv[0].tv_nsec`; `efs_client_set_atime` / `efs_client_utimens_both`
   carry `atime` as seconds; `host_utimens` stores
   `u.atime = atime * 1000000000`. mtime keeps its nanoseconds
   (`msec`, `nsec`), atime does not. ecopy compares full timespecs, so
   every file whose `futimens` *succeeded* then fails the atime check.
   Reads do not touch atime anywhere in the tree, so this is the whole
   cause.
3. **`ftruncate` EAGAIN = the SETATTR BUSY budget (W24), mapped
   differently.** `efs_fuse_truncate_ino` returns
   `efs_rc_to_errno(EFS_ERR_BUSY)` = **EAGAIN**; W16 step 1's
   `fuse_stat_errno` maps the same BUSY to **EBUSY** for
   getattr/lookup/create. Two errnos for one condition; ecopy treats
   EAGAIN as a failure and moves on. The cause is W24/W22; the mapping
   is this item.

What to implement:

1. **`host_utimens` fences cross-group lanes the way `host_truncate`
   does** (propose the LANE_FENCE entries on the other group first, then
   the UTIMENS entry; the same helper). If the fence is unnecessary for
   a pure mtime set — the fence exists so an in-flight REPORT on another
   lane cannot re-stamp "now" over the set time — then the UTIMENS entry
   needs the `mtime_gen` bump the apply already checks, per lane group;
   decide by reading `efs_meta_apply` UTIMENS/REPORT ordering, and say
   which. Gate: `futimens` on a 2 GiB file returns 0 and `stat` shows
   the set mtime; posix 1 `utimens*` and posix 2 `peer_utimens_visible`
   unchanged; `cp -p` / `ecopy` of a 1 GiB file reports no `futimens`
   error.
2. **Carry `atime_nsec` end to end**: `efs_fuse_utimens_ino` →
   `efs_client_set_atime` / `_utimens_both` → `efs_msg_inode_setattr`
   (add the field; wire change, bump nothing else) → `host_utimens`
   `u.atime = atime*1e9 + atime_nsec` → `efs_meta_setattr` → row. Gate:
   `touch -a -d '@1500000000.123456789'` then `stat` shows
   `.123456789`; ecopy's atime check passes on the small-file tree.
3. **One mapping for BUSY.** `efs_rc_to_errno` returns `-EBUSY` for
   `EFS_ERR_BUSY` (keep EAGAIN for `EFS_ERR_AGAIN` only), so truncate,
   utimens, chmod, and the stat path agree. Gate: posix 1 jobs=1
   200/201; grep the suite for tests that assert EAGAIN on BUSY (there
   should be none; if one exists, that test is wrong about the
   contract, not this change).

- **Gate:** the three above plus posix 1 9-host not worse than the
  last run.
- **Forbidden:** setting mtime without fencing or bumping `mtime_gen`
  (a later REPORT would restore "now" — the exact bug
  `setattr_rpc_dual_apply`'s comment describes); rounding atime on the
  server to hide step 2; mapping BUSY to EIO.

#### W12 — Repo hygiene

> **Current status (Oct 2 2026; a document claim — the cited gate directory is the evidence):** STANDING RULE, not a queue item. Pruned to the rule Oct 1.
>
> **Remaining action:** apply it whenever a run directory is cited or stops being cited.
>
> **Governing decision:** none.
>
> **Gate:** `results/` contains only directories a live document cites.

**Historical record (dated).** Evidence and steps as they were written at the time. A step marked *done* or *superseded* in the status block above is not to be executed; its text stays so the gate directories and the reasoning remain findable.

`results/` holds only runs that a live document cites (this page, the
rules, `docs/`, `tests/`; `project-history.md` and `design-history.md` are
archives and do not count). Commit a run directory when it is cited as a
gate; otherwise delete it. Pruned to that rule on Oct 1 2026; `git log --
results/` keeps the rest.

Run `python3 docs/gen-architecture-full.py` (or `make docs-check`) after any doc edit: it regenerates
`architecture-full.md` **and** `architecture.html` from the markdown sources
and validates links plus every `I1..I25` reference. Never edit either
generated file. `make test` must be fully green — there is no
accepted-failure list.

**Idea checked Oct 1 2026 — synchronous encryption. Not a decision. Do not implement.**

The user asked how transport and at-rest encryption could work, and whether a key created with the cluster would let only the Linux user who mounts with that key see the contents. Conclusions, for a later design pass:

- Nothing encrypts today. `EFS_MSG_HELLO` checks the build id. Any host that can reach 19810 is a peer. Modes are enforced in the FUSE process; the client tells the server its uid (`docs/product-gaps.md`).
- One key, created at `raft-mkfs` and shown once. The cluster stores a verifier, not the key. A mount proves it knows the key. The key file is mode `0600` and the mount is not `allow_other`, so other uids on that machine see nothing at the mount point. Root on that machine can still read the key (ptrace is open here). Any other host that has the key can mount. Every holder of the key sees every byte it encrypts. Per-user secrecy is a different key per user.
- Fragments, on the client, after parity. Split the chunk, XOR the parity, then encrypt each of the three fragments with its own IV stored beside the fragment. `PUT` and the disk see only ciphertext. A read decrypts, then XORs if it must rebuild one fragment. XOR of ciphertext does not reconstruct, so encryption sits outside the parity. The object name stays a hash of the plaintext, so two clients still agree on one object; the IV is not part of that name. The server stores opaque fragments and does not need the key to hold them.
- Metadata is the open choice. Names and directory updates are applied by the servers. Without the key they cannot apply encrypted names, so either the namespace stays plaintext on disk (a pulled NVMe reveals names, not file bytes) or `efsd` is unlocked with the key at start and the KV and Raft log are encrypted on the way to disk. The key must not live in the Raft log, or the disk contains the key that decrypts the disk. A server that was not unlocked cannot serve.
- Transport is the same idea on the frame: encrypt before send, decrypt before the handler, on the RDMA path and on the TCP side channel large frames already use. A traffic key derived from the cluster key at connect. Ciphertext fragments on the wire still show sizes and which object was touched; the frame hides names and the access pattern.
- "Synchronous" means the `pwrite` and the wire only ever see ciphertext. There is no later encryption pass.

**Decisions only the user can make — bring the evidence, do not start.**
These came out of reviewing efs as an HPC parallel filesystem. Each one
changes what efs *is*, so an agent must not pick a side; but each has a
cheap measurement an agent can produce first, named here:

- **Per-file layout control.** Chunk size and the EC profile are per export;
  there is no per-file or per-directory equivalent of Lustre's `lfs
  setstripe`. A 4 KiB-record checkpoint and a 1 GiB-per-rank dump therefore
  get the same 128 KiB geometry, and the declared 32× small-write
  amplification ([architecture.md §9](../architecture.md)) has no opt-out.
  Evidence to bring: W6's IOR-hard/IOR-easy ratio and rw-4k from W4.
- **An interface beyond FUSE.** FUSE is the only client. libfuse 3.10.2 cannot
  negotiate `FUSE_MAX_PAGES`, so every request is ≤128 KiB regardless of
  `max_write`; it cannot emit `FOPEN_PARALLEL_DIRECT_WRITES`; and Linux takes
  the inode lock exclusively for extending direct writes and the parent
  directory lock for `O_CREAT`, **per mount** (already in
  [architecture.md §9](../architecture.md) as an open kernel-interface item).
  So 64 ranks on one node writing one file serialize in the kernel before efs
  is called. Every production PFS has a kernel client, a user-space library,
  or an MPI-IO ADIO driver. Evidence to bring: W4's per-client scaling and a
  1-node 8-rank IOR-easy vs 8-node 1-rank IOR-easy comparison from W6.
- **Whether `write()` is durable** — W2 closed: spec says `fsync`/`close`/
  `O_SYNC`. Do not reopen as publish-on-write. `O_SYNC` wiring is a later
  item, not a silent side-cut.
- Already listed before this review: C1 relaxed coherence; a pressure-triggered
  directory-spread bound (unspecified); cutover of a 36T `efs-test`; any new
  REPORT or SNAP wire shape.

**Bigger than this queue.** [product-gaps.md](../product-gaps.md) inventories
what is missing before efs is a filesystem anyone could run — including the
things that contradict a guarantee the spec already makes (no fragment
repair, no protection-debt tracking, no session/fencing on the client, and
W1/W2 in [../project-history.md](../project-history.md) "START-HERE closed items"). Those are not queue items beyond what W1–W2 say; each needs a
design decision first. Do not start one without asking, and do not treat the
queue in [START-HERE.md](START-HERE.md) §1a as the whole distance to a product.

#### W22 — Server: the snapshot cadence makes InstallSnapshot the steady state, and a follower inside an import campaigns

> **Current status (Oct 2 2026; a document claim — the cited gate directory is the evidence):** DONE by document claim: D4 (snapshot by log bytes, retained window) and D5 (sliced import) rolled Sep 29; D6 closed by D11 (not the sharing; `--meta-storage` exists, default unchanged); the rotated-SNAP-record replay bug was fixed Oct 1 (`test_rotation`).
>
> **Remaining action:** none.
>
> **Governing decision:** D4, D5, D11.
>
> **Gate:** `import start` count 0 on every node across a 9×4 IOR; no term change; `make test` (`test_raft_store`).

**Historical record (dated).** Evidence and steps as they were written at the time. A step marked *done* or *superseded* in the status block above is not to be executed; its text stays so the gate directories and the reasoning remain findable.

**Status (Sep 29 2026, 04:27Z).** Steps 1 and 2 are in tree and rolled
(04:08Z, `54a500da9dc8-dirty`): a group snapshots at 512 MiB of log
commands past `snap_idx` (`EFS_RAFT_SNAP_BYTES`), `raft_group_snap`
keeps that window (`log_base`, recorded in the SNAP record so a rotated
log replays it), `send_ae` InstallSnapshots only below
`efs_raft_log_floor`; the import diff is applied 1024 keys per pump
cycle (`HOST_SNAP_SLICE`, state `SNAP_IMP_APPLY`) and the last-chunk
retry stays BUSY until the cursor finishes. First 20 minutes on the
cluster, with a 7-minute write in them: zero `raft-snap: start` on any
node, no import. The byte counter's first version walked the log on
every tick (1–1.25 % of every server); the O(1) version is in tree, not
rolled. Step 3's flag `--meta-storage` is in tree with the default
layout; its measurement is **closed by D11** — the per-thread `fsync`
histograms from that trace put the Raft log at 0.4 ms and the 100 ms
mode on the compactor's own segments. What the trace found instead is
W23. Order-table rows 8a, 8b done; 8d closed.

**Source (Sep 29 2026 02:35–02:41Z, `results/io500/20260929-023447-iorperf2/ana`,
9-client `run.sh ior`, perf + `strace -f -tt -T` on every daemon).**

- `host_maybe_snapshot` (`raft_host.c`, `HOST_SNAP_MIN` = 256) starts an
  export as soon as 256 entries have applied since the last one and the
  previous export has finished. The export is the whole KV: 2.67 GB,
  4.6–12 s each, so every node exports back to back for the whole run
  (`raft-snap: start/end` pairs 256 entries apart; fcstor005 twelve of
  them in six minutes). `efs_kv_lsm_view_export` `memcmp` +
  `vx_sift_down` is the top user symbol on all four servers (14 % of
  fcstor004's samples on the GC thread).
- `send_ae` (`raft.c:672`) sends InstallSnapshot to a peer whose
  `next_index ≤ snap_idx`; with the snap point moving every 256
  entries, a follower 257 entries behind gets the 2.67 GB file instead
  of 257 log entries. fcstor006 imported group 2 twice (`import diff
  n=685534 ms=12132`, `n=130398 ms=16467`), fcstor003 imported group 0
  once (`n=380716 ms=12041`).
- The import diff is applied on the follower's pump on the ack (W14
  step 1 moved the scan and sort off the pump; the apply stayed). For
  those 12–16 s the follower answers no heartbeat. Group 0 term moved
  9370 → 9415 and group 2 2792 → 2897 across the run with `drop=0` on
  every `raft-obs tx->` line on all four nodes — the outbox coalesce
  (W14.2 (a)–(b)) removed the drops and the terms still moved. The
  group-2 leader answered 15 REPORTs NOT_PRIMARY and fcstor005 answered
  32 as a transient leader.
- fcstor004's busiest thread (22 % of samples) is the compactor:
  sequential 8050-byte `pread` of one segment, 4 KiB `write`s of the
  new one, and a segment `fsync` at a flat 100 ms, 97 times.
  `persist_max` reached 254 ms. The twenty writer-pool threads create
  fragments on the same XFS (`/data1/01`, ~14 s of `openat`/`write`/
  `close` each). The Raft log, the KV WAL, the segments, and the data
  share one journal.
- Net effect on a client: one REPORT of 86 234 records held the RPC for
  20.5 s (`pack_ms=1431 push_ms=9869 finish_ms=9227 rc=-13`), which is
  the client's `recvfrom` of 19.36 s and the `rounds=1 rc=-13` fsync EIO
  that aborted IOR. The pump itself was not held: `pump_hold_max` 59 ms,
  `apply_max` 69 µs on the leader in this run.

**Steps, each its own change with its own gate (D4–D6 decided):**

1. **Snapshot by log bytes; keep a log window (D4).** In
   `host_maybe_snapshot`: replace `applied ≥ snap + HOST_SNAP_MIN` with
   "bytes appended to this group's log since `snap_idx` ≥ 512 MiB"
   (the store knows its size; count entry `clen` at append if it does
   not). In the store's `save_snap`: keep the log entries after the
   snapshot point instead of truncating at it — retain a window of the
   last `W` entries (start with the same 512 MiB worth; the window is
   internal, no knob) and drop only what falls out of it. In `send_ae`
   (`raft.c:672`): send InstallSnapshot only when `next_index` is below
   the retained window's first index, not when it is `≤ snap_idx`.
   `snap_ensure` / `send_snap` keep re-exporting on demand for a peer
   that is genuinely below the window (fresh node, wiped `mdraft/`).
   Gate: over a 9-client `run.sh ior`, `raft-snap: start` per group at
   most once per 512 MiB of log; `import start` count 0 on every node
   unless one was restarted; `efs_kv_lsm_view_export` under 2 % of
   every server's samples; `test_raft` OK; fcstor005 bounce-and-rejoin
   still catches up (from the log now, not a file).
2. **Slice the import-diff apply (D5).** Today the pump applies the whole
   diff batch on the ack. Make the import state machine resumable: the
   pump applies at most one `HOST_TICK_US` of diff keys per cycle
   (measure keys/µs once; a fixed count per cycle is fine), releases,
   drains the inbox and answers AppendEntries as a follower, and
   continues on the next cycle; the SNAP_REP that acks the last chunk
   goes out when the final slice is in (until then the retry of that
   chunk keeps getting BUSY, as it does now). Gate: force an
   InstallSnapshot under load (bounce one voter after wiping its
   `mdraft/`, with a 9-client write running); `apply_max` under 70 ms
   throughout, no term change on the importing group during the
   import, `tests/measure/i17_leader_freeze.sh` still passes; the
   follower's `commit == applied` catches up to the leader after the
   import.
3. **Metadata root off the fragment root (D6).** Measure first, on one
   server, with the cluster serving a 9-client write: `dd if=/dev/urandom
   of=<root>/fsync-probe bs=4k count=1 conv=fsync` 200 times on
   `/data1/01` (shared) and on a root with no writers (stop one path
   from `--storage` on a scratch efsd, or use a directory on `/` for the
   comparison only), p50/p99 of each into
   `results/measure/<stamp>-fsync-root/`. If the shared root shows the
   100 ms mode and the quiet one does not: add `--meta-storage <root>`
   to `efsd` (default the first `--storage` root — today's layout, no
   migration of existing `mdraft/`), then redeploy 19810 with `mdraft/`
   on a root none of the six `--storage` paths use (ask which device;
   this is a cluster layout change). Gate: compactor and pump `fsync`
   p99 under 10 ms in an `EFS_STRACE_EXPR='trace=fsync,fdatasync'`
   trace of a 9-client write; `persist_max` under 20 ms. If the quiet
   root shows the same 100 ms mode, this step is closed as "not the
   sharing" and the number goes to the user.

- **Gate:** the three above; posix 1 jobs=1 200/201 and 9-host, posix 2
  63/63; a 9-client `run.sh ior` that completes ior-easy-write with zero
  `report-loop … rc=-13` lines; 9-client 8 GiB dd not worse than 2551.5.
- **Forbidden:** raising the election timeout or `HOST_TICK_US`; widening
  the 400 ms apply budget or the 16-attempt RPC budget to hide the wait;
  putting the import scan/sort back on the pump (W14 step 1); changing
  `EFS_RAFT_SNAP_CHUNK`; a global or thread-local fd cache (W14 step 4).

**Two measurement notes from this run.** Both perf profiles carry the
concurrent strace (`ptrace_do_notify` 4–5 % on every host; ~40 % of the
client's `children` view is ptrace stops), so shares are inflated toward
syscall-heavy threads — profile with one recorder at a time when a share
matters. And an un-narrowed server `--strace` is ~2 GB per 6 minutes;
use `EFS_STRACE_EXPR`.

#### W23 — Server: the apply path blocks on L0 back-pressure, and compaction rewrites the table to absorb a few MiB

> **Current status (Oct 2 2026; a document claim — the cited gate directory is the evidence):** D9–D13 DECIDED and rolled (Sep 29; the "pending" header below is historical). Open under this number: (1) the **memory / lag bound is unproven** — see the correction below the steps; (2) the GC frag pass over a 50-file L0 steady state is **D26** (decided: watermark first, after W44 a).
>
> **Remaining action:** the stalled-compactor test in the correction below; then D26 per its row.
>
> **Governing decision:** D9–D13, D26.
>
> **Gate:** the stalled-compactor test's numbers recorded in `results/measure/`; `md_latency.py` medians unchanged; no `kv-compact: backpressure` line in a 9×4 IOR.

**Historical record (dated).** Evidence and steps as they were written at the time. A step marked *done* or *superseded* in the status block above is not to be executed; its text stays so the gate directories and the reasoning remain findable.

**Status (Sep 29 2026, 05:11Z).** In tree and rolled
(`a53b253f2455-dirty`, RDMA, `--perf --strace`). Step 1: the apply path
does not wait in `kv_maybe_flush_locked`; a publish batch returns BUSY
from `host_pub_batch_propose` while L0 is within one flush of the cap.
Step 2: a range is compacted when its L0 bytes are at least 1/8 of its
L1 bytes (or when L0 is at the file cap, whichever comes first);
`key[0]==0` is 16 subranges (`key[1]`'s top nibble) at flush and at
compaction output; compaction iterators read 1 MiB ahead. Not gated.
The 1 GiB L0 byte cap in place of the 64-file array is not in this
change — the file cap still forces a compaction, but of one subrange.

**Source (Sep 29 2026 04:07–04:27Z, `results/measure/20260929-040800-idle-trace/ana`,
perf + `strace -f -tt -T` on every daemon, a user `ecopy` 04:15–04:22Z
writing 408K fragments per server; the handoff archive in [../project-history.md](../project-history.md) has the full list).**

- `kv_maybe_flush_locked` (`kv_compact.c:711`) waits on `l->cv` while
  `n_l0 + KV_LSM_RANGE_MAX > KV_LSM_MAX_SEGS` (i.e. L0 ≥ 48 files). The
  caller is the apply path on the pump under `h->mu`. On fcstor004 the
  pump's `futex` waits were 4.14, 1.68, **24.23**, 2.70, 3.57 s, each the
  length of one `kv-compact: end ms=`; `pump_hold_max` 4.4 s (history
  6.4 s), `apply_max` 4.4 s. fcstor005 2.14 s. W13 step 2 documented
  this wait as "the only stall left" and logged it (`kv-compact:
  backpressure n_l0=`); the log shows it continuously through the write.
- While the pump is held: `host_wait_applied` hits its 400 ms deadline
  (`raft-host: apply-sleep us=400xxx`, dozens per hold) → the REPORT
  answers BUSY (`report-split nrec=76757 … finish_ms=1881 rc=-13`; 12 of
  116 on 004) → the client's `fsync` returns EIO (W17.1) — the same
  abort the last two IORs died of. No heartbeat leaves either: group 0
  9418→9421 (04:15:43Z), group 2 2902→2904 (04:16:17Z), inside the
  holds. With W22.1–2 rolled and zero snapshot activity, this is the
  multi-second pump hold that is left.
- Why L0 is always near the cap: a flush writes one L0 file per
  `key[0]` range (W13 step 5, ≤ 16 files of ~256 KB from a 4 MiB
  memtable); compaction takes one range's L0 files (`inputs=` 5–11) and
  rewrites that range's whole L1 — 190–330 MB for ranges 1–15, **1.8 GB
  for range 0**. 433 compactions in 20 minutes on 004 (441 / 648 / 656
  on 005 / 003 / 006) summed to **159 GB** of `bytes=` against a 5.3 GB
  table; range 0's 34 rewrites are 61 GB of that and the 24 s hold. The
  compactor thread is 48 % / 55 % of fcstor004 / fcstor005's samples
  (`cm_sift_up`, `memcmp`, `cm_pop`, `kv_seg_probe`), with 5.25M 4 KiB
  `write`s (stdio default buffer) and 3.7M ~8 KB `pread`s (one per
  input block).
- The compactor's segment `fsync` is the 100 ms mode (299 of 695 on 004
  in 90–120 ms, avg 51 ms; 407 of 733 on 005); the pump's Raft-log
  `fsync` averages 0.38–0.40 ms. That closes D6 (D11): not the sharing.

**Steps as written Sep 29 (D9–D10 were DECIDED the same day and rolled 05:31Z; D12/D13 followed — historical):**

1. **The pump never waits for the compactor (D9).** In
   `kv_maybe_flush_locked`, when the caller is the apply path (pass a
   flag, or make the apply's flush a separate entry point), do not wait:
   flush what can be placed, or let the memtable grow past
   `memtable_max` and return OK; the memtable is bounded by what the log
   can commit ahead of the KV (512 MiB since W22.1). Back-pressure moves
   to admission: `host_propose` (or the REPORT handler before it)
   returns BUSY when the local L0 bytes are over the cap, so the client
   retries on its existing 16-attempt / 10 s budget and no follower's
   pump ever stalls. `kv_compact_locked` for tests and `--compact` keeps
   the synchronous path. Gate: a 9-client `run.sh ior` with `pump_hold_max`
   under 100 ms on every node throughout (`raft-obs`), zero
   `apply-sleep` lines above 100 ms, zero `report-split … rc=-13`, no
   term change on either group; `make test`.
2. **Compaction by bytes, and a bounded range (D10).** (a) A range is
   compacted when its pending L0 bytes reach 1/8 of its L1 bytes
   (`kv-compact: start` logs both); the L0 cap becomes a byte budget
   (1 GiB) and the 64-file cap goes — the read path already probes every
   L0 file, so the file count is not the constraint. (b) A range whose
   L1 exceeds ~256 MB is split on the next key byte at flush and at
   compaction output, so no single rewrite exceeds that. (c) The merge
   reads each input segment through a 1 MiB sequential buffer instead of
   one `pread` per block. Gate: over the same IOR, `kv-compact: end`
   `bytes=` sum under 10× the KV's growth for the run; no compaction over
   1 s; compactor under 15 % of any server's samples; `test_kv_lsm` and
   `test_partitioned_flush` pass; a KV copy from a live node reopens and
   verifies every key.
3. **Already in tree (8g), roll with the next build:** `disk_log_new_bytes`
   O(1); `kv_seg_w_open` `setvbuf` 1 MiB.

**Correction (Oct 2 2026) — the bound in step 1 is unproven.** Step 1
says the memtable "is bounded by what the log can commit ahead of the
KV (512 MiB since W22.1)". It is not: the 512 MiB figure is a
*snapshot trigger*; it neither admits nor refuses writes, and a
follower acknowledges AppendEntries on log persist, not on apply, so
a follower whose compactor is stalled accumulates unapplied log (on
disk) without the leader noticing except through follower-served
`host_wait_applied` timeouts. The mechanisms that actually exist:
(a) `memtable_max` flushes the memtable to an L0 file; (b) the 64-file
L0 cap, at which the apply path **blocks** (`kv-compact: backpressure`)
— a pump stall, which is the thing D9 forbids, so today the bound is a
stall; (c) D9's admission BUSY on local L0 bytes over 1 GiB applies to
the leader's own KV only; (d) D12/D13 keep `n_l0` under the cap by
L0→L0 merges while the compactor runs. **Remaining action (no
decision needed to measure).** Fault hook `EFS_FAULT_COMPACT_STALL=1`
(compiled only with `EFS_FAULTS=1`), **fault location:** `compactor_main`
parks at the top of its loop, *between* iterations, holding neither
`l->mu` nor `h->mu` and owning no pinned view — i.e. the compactor is
alive but never starts a merge. Memtable flushes to L0 (`kv_flush_locked`,
apply-path) continue; only L0→L1 and the D12/D13 L0→L0 merges stop.
Parking while holding `l->mu` would test a lock-hold, a different
failure, and is not this experiment. **Run:** private 3-node cluster
(`tests/rdma_first_inode.sh` layout on one fcstor, `/dev/shm` or a scratch
dir), one client, `dd bs=1M` of a non-zero source to fresh files, the
hook set on **one follower only** (the leader keeps compacting, so the
leader-side admission (c) is not what fires). **Sample every 5 s per
node:** memtable bytes, `n_l0`, `pump_hold_max`, `apply-sleep` count,
`kv-compact: backpressure` count, `commit − applied`, RSS. **Bounded
stopping condition — stop at the first of:** the follower logs
`kv-compact: backpressure` (bound = the stall at 64 L0 files, name the
bytes written at that point); follower RSS exceeds 2× its pre-run RSS;
follower `commit − applied` exceeds 10 000 entries for 30 s; 10 GiB
written; 10 minutes. **Then** clear the hook (`/tmp/efs/fault`) and
record how long the follower takes to reach `commit == applied` (must be
under 2 min, else that is a second finding). **Result:** the dir under
`results/measure/` names which of (a)–(d) stopped the run and at what
size. A finite run can show a bound that fired, or lag that grew for the
whole run with no bound observed; it cannot prove unbounded growth —
write whichever it is. If the answer is "a pump stall at 64 L0 files" or
"no bound observed within 10 GiB / 10 min", that is a design ask (a
follower-lag admission rule) — bring the numbers, do not pick.

- **Read:** `src/kv/kv_compact.c` (`kv_maybe_flush_locked`, `compactor_main`,
  `kv_compact_locked`), `src/kv/kv_lsm.c` (`kv_flush_locked`), `src/kv/kv_seg.c`,
  W13 (closed; [../project-history.md](../project-history.md) "START-HERE closed items") and the
  "L1 compaction is a background thread" learning in the project-state rule.
- **Forbidden:** raising `KV_LSM_MEM_DEFAULT` or `KV_LSM_L0_DEFAULT` as the
  fix (W13, closed); raising the election timeout, `HOST_TICK_US`, or the 400 ms
  apply budget; any compaction step under `h->mu`; making `fsync` succeed
  on a merged-back dirty set; moving `mdraft/` to another device to hide
  the compactor's I/O (D11 says it is not the sharing).

**When START-HERE's queue is empty,** the next task comes from a measurement,
not from this page: run the gates in [testing.md](../testing.md), and take
the largest gap between what a gate reports and what the ceiling table in
[START-HERE.md](START-HERE.md) §1a says the hardware allows. If closing it needs a design
decision the spec does not contain, stop and ask ([START-HERE.md](START-HERE.md) §4).
