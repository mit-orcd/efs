# W95: TCP/direct-I/O small-file packing qualification

## Scope and current state

User authorized root-only work on `devel`, exclusive AMD use, ordinary files
storage engine/TCP/direct I/O with small-file packing enabled. Client
`EFS_COMMANDS=0` and daemon `EFS_COMMANDS_SERVER=0` throughout. Containers,
RDMA and query/cache work are outside this task. No push or release/tag changes.

The mounted packing fixture previously enabled command/query features by default.
It now forces both command flags off and selects the original core POSIX suite,
independently of inherited command-enabled environment. Its summary records the
packing and command flags. Physical packing, mutation, peer, cold-byte and
reclamation assertions and original deadlines remain unchanged.

Current candidate: fixture isolation only; deployment/live qualification NOTRUN.
Older mounted packing failures are source-specific. The newer 32-frame receive
batch fixed ordinary deep-path qualification with packing disabled; its effect
on packing remains unverified. Lower-layer packing, decoder, admission, retry,
publication and ledger tests do not establish mounted acceptance.

## Reproduction

On a Linux AMD host with compiler/dependencies, FUSE, Python 3 and screen, check
out the named `devel` commit from the result checkpoint. Build with `make -j8`.
Use two existing root parents on the designated EFS test filesystem, never an
existing live storage directory. Four fresh private nodes use explicit 4G quotas.
The harness retains raw output in its unique `gc-direct-*` directory; keep that
outside Git. Ensure ports 34840–34843 are unused and use an isolated empty mount
allowed by the host's FUSE policy. No profilers or competing builds during quiet
qualification.

```sh
EFS_PACKED_WRITES=1 EFS_COMMANDS=0 EFS_COMMANDS_SERVER=0 EFS_REPAIR_EXPERIMENT=0 \
python3 tests/live/gc_reclamation.py --mode direct --transport tcp \
  --root /data1/efs/packing-qualification/root-a \
  --root /data1/efs/packing-qualification/root-b \
  --port 34840 --fixture-quota 4G --mounted-packing-only --disable-efs-commands
```

The focused run creates 64 concurrently fsynced 512-byte files, requires actual
packed fragments, verifies peer bytes, promotes/grows one file, truncates another,
unlinks one, checks unaffected neighbours, restarts all four nodes, verifies
acknowledged bytes, deletes survivors and requires physical packed reclamation
and metadata queue drain within the original 180-second deadlines.

Then repeat on fresh fixture directories/ports with
`--posix --packing-clients 7 --posix-jobs 16`. Expected: 216 core cases per
client (1512 total), original 30-second per-case deadlines, peer suite 67/67,
clean shutdown, the same cold hashes and physical reclamation. Harness `finally`
cleans owned processes/mounts; retain failed fixtures externally for diagnosis.
Inspect cleanup output before deleting only those private fixture directories.

## Remaining gates

Focused mounted lifecycle; full seven-client quiet acceptance; meaningful fault
and sanitizer regressions for identified defects; repeated current-source cold
and shared-object reclamation; matched packing-on/off throughput, durable-close
latency, allocation and CPU comparison. Record exact executed commit, binary
hashes, host/configuration, verdicts, raw location and limitations here.
