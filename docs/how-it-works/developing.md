Modularity is not a style preference here — it is what makes the two things
this project depends on possible at all: **fast isolated testing** (see
[verification.md](verification.md)) and **bounded-context change** (a human
or a model editing one component without ingesting the whole codebase). A
system this subtle cannot afford either to be slow to test or to require
global knowledge to change safely.

**The bar, stated plainly: a *less advanced* AI model must be able to
contribute a correct change.** Not "the best available model, with the whole
tree in context, on a good day" — a modest one. That is a much stronger
requirement than "the code is organized," and it has concrete consequences:

- **Local correctness must be locally decidable.** Whether a change to module
  X is right must be answerable from X's source + X's interface header + X's
  tests — never from global reasoning about the whole system. If correctness
  requires holding the whole tree in your head, only the strongest
  contributors can play, and the project scales with *model quality* instead
  of with *contributor count*.
- **The blast radius of a mistake is one module.** A weak contributor's error
  must fail *fast and locally* — a unit test, a simulator assertion, an
  interface-contract check — not subtly, three subsystems away, in
  production. The safety net is executable (tests, invariants, the
  simulator), so the quality bar is enforced by the *boundaries*, not by the
  sophistication of whoever is editing.
- **Interfaces carry the contract.** Each module's header states what it
  guarantees and what it requires (invariants, ownership, threading rules) —
  so a contributor doesn't have to *derive* the contract from the rest of the
  tree before touching anything.

**The rule.** A module must be understandable, changeable, and testable from
**its own source plus its interface header alone**. If you have to read the
rest of the tree to change one component safely, the modularity has failed —
regardless of how the directories are named.

**Source-size snapshot (Oct 7, 2026).** The file-size target is not met:
`server/raft_host.c` 13056 lines, `client/write.c` 7301 lines, `meta/meta_apply.c` 7709 lines, `client/efs_fuse.c` 7128 lines, `meta/metadata.c` 3884 lines.
These counts describe the reviewed working tree, not a permanent module budget.
Split by responsibility when the selected task touches a large module; this
review does not authorize unrelated refactoring.

**Boundaries** (aligned with the planes, so the architecture and the
code structure are the same map):

```text
raft/       the consensus core — a pure state machine, transport- and
            storage-agnostic; no I/O inline, no globals (`raft.c`,
            `raft_disk.c` on-disk log, `raft_mem.c` for the simulator).
kv/         the ordered applied state — `kv_mem.c` for the simulator,
            `kv_lsm.c` + `kv_wal.c` + `kv_seg.c` + `kv_compact.c` +
            `kv_snap.c` on disk, behind `include/efs/kv.h`.
meta/       the POSIX op state machine over kv/ and raft/ (`meta_apply.c`,
            `txn.c`, `session.c`, `lock.c`, `dir_*.c`); no socket or FUSE
            calls inline. `metadata.c` is the client-side staging table.
wire/       the protocol — versioned encode/decode, nothing else.
data/       the data plane — EC encode/decode, store + transport vtables
            (`efs/store.h`, `efs/transport.h`), loop/conn transports.
server/     `efsd`: handlers, the production Raft host (`raft_host.c`),
            the NVMe fragment store (`store.c`), writer pool, peer pool.
client/     `efs-fuse`: `efs_fuse.c` is the FUSE adapter; `ops.c`,
            `read.c`, `write.c`, `inode_rpc.c`, `stage_evict.c` hold the
            path/RPC/data logic.
sim/        the deterministic simulator the state machines run under.
```

**Rules that enforce it:**

- **Depend on the interface, not the implementation.** Modules include each
  other's *headers*, never reach into another module's `.c` internals. The
  current `g_server->lock` / shared-global pattern is the anti-example — it
  is what forced whole-subsystem context for every change.
- **State machines are pure.** No hidden globals, no I/O inline; all I/O goes
  through the transport/storage interfaces. This is *also* the property that
  lets the same compiled state machine run under the simulator
  ([verification.md](verification.md)) — purity buys testability and
  simulatability at once.
- **Every module has a unit test that links only its real dependencies** (or
  interface fakes) and runs in milliseconds. A change to `raft/` must not
  require a `client/` rebuild — mentally or literally.
- **Context budget.** A module plus its interface should fit in a few hundred
  lines, so a change can be made and reviewed with bounded context. Working
  target: **no source file over ~1000 lines**; split by responsibility when
  one crosses it. This is the property that lets a model (or a new
  contributor) load one module and make a correct change without the whole
  tree in scope.
- **Conventions are machine-checkable.** Formatting, naming, and the
  interface/ownership rules are enforced by tooling (lint, the build, the
  test gate), not by reviewer vigilance — a less advanced contributor
  (human or model) cannot silently violate a rule the tooling would have
  caught.

## The specification itself is under a machine gate

The same argument applies to the documents. A normative index plus satellites
is only safer than a monolith if the split cannot silently drift — otherwise
a contradiction between the index and a satellite is just a monolith with
extra steps, and the contributor who reads only one of them is misled. The
documentation gate is therefore part of the build, not an editorial habit:

```text
regenerate docs/how-it-works/architecture-full.md and fail on any diff
    -> the generated review artifact can never be stale

validate internal links in normative sources, all active docs and root README
    -> the index-plus-satellite structure stays navigable

validate every invariant reference (I1..I25) names a defined invariant
    -> "preserves I21" cannot survive renumbering

validate every operation in the §6 matrix names an existing protocol section

reject a normative table defined in more than one place
    -> placement formulas, the op matrix and the invariant list have exactly
       one home; satellites explain them, never restate them
```

The last check is the one that matters most: duplicated normative tables are
how the index and a satellite come to disagree, and the rule "if they
disagree, the index wins" is a fallback, not a substitute for the tables
being single-sourced.

The gate is `docs/check-architecture.py` (stdlib only). Run it with
`make docs-check` (login-node safe) or as part of `make test` on a build
node. It regenerates `architecture-full.md` into a temp file and diffs;
it never clobbers the checked-in copy.

**Why it is in the architecture and not a style guide:** the migration
(§10 of the spec) lands Raft, KV, and the transaction protocol as *new*
components. If they are built to these boundaries from the start, the
simulator and the unit harness get them for free, and the dev cycle stays
fast as the system grows. If they are built as another 6000-line
`metadata.c`, no amount of testing infrastructure will save the cycle time.

## 2. Routing: "I am changing X"

Read the row's **Read** column and nothing else first. The **Governs** column
is what your change must not break; the **Gate** column is what proves it.

| You are changing | Read | Governs | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Any wire message | [architecture.md §7](architecture.md) op matrix, `include/efs/protocol.h` | build-ID compat; restart all servers together | `make test`, solo posix |
| Path lookup / dentries | [protocols/directory.md](protocols/directory.md) | I5–I8 | posix, posix2 |
| create / unlink / rename / link | [protocols/directory.md](protocols/directory.md), [protocols/transactions.md](protocols/transactions.md) | I5–I9, I16, I17 | posix, posix2, posixstress |
| Anything about file size, mtime, ctime | [protocols/data.md](protocols/data.md) "lanes"/"times" | I21, I22 | posix (size-visibility tests), posix2 |
| Chunk write / publish / truncate / append | [protocols/data.md](protocols/data.md) | I11–I15, I20–I22, I24, I25 | posix, posixpersist, fio honest matrix |
| The read path, or read prefetch/caching | [protocols/data.md](protocols/data.md) "validated collect" | I24, I13 | posix, posix2 (cross-client visibility) |
| Client reconnect, leases, locks, open-unlinked | [protocols/sessions.md](protocols/sessions.md) | I19, I23, I16 | posix2, posixstress |
| Cross-shard anything | [protocols/transactions.md](protocols/transactions.md) | I16, I17, I9 | posix2, posixstress |
| Raft, KV, replication, membership | [architecture.md §7.1/§7.8](architecture.md), [failure-tolerance.md](failure-tolerance.md) | I1–I4, I10, I18 | `tests/test_sim`, leaks |
| Production Raft host | `src/server/raft_host.c`, [architecture.md §10](architecture.md) 10.5 | I1–I4, I16; never `efs_raft_snapshot()` until KV flush-through-applied; SNAP blob is the existing WAL item payload | `tests/test_kv_lsm`, `tests/test_wire`, `tests/stress/raft_host_smoke.sh` (scratch cluster; not live `efs-test`) |
| Simulator / applied KV SM | [verification.md](verification.md), `include/efs/sim.h`, `include/efs/meta_apply.h`, `include/efs/raft.h` | I1–I4, I9, I10, I13–I16, I20–I23, I25 | `tests/test_sim`, `tests/test_meta_apply`, `tests/test_raft` |
| Op-ID / idempotency window | [architecture.md §7.9](architecture.md), `include/efs/opid.h` | I16 | `tests/test_sim` |
| A hot path, for speed | [performance.md](performance.md) | P1–P4, §8 contract | fio honest matrix — **never** the stock `perf` write column |
| FUSE client behavior | [architecture.md §7.7](architecture.md) | I24, kernel-cache rules | posix, posix2 |
| Module structure / file layout | [development.md](developing.md) | ~1000-line file cap; header-only deps | `make test` + the suite for whatever moved |
| The spec itself | [development.md](developing.md) "machine gate" | one home per normative table | regenerate `architecture-full.md`; links + `I1..I25` resolve |

Invariant texts live in [architecture.md](architecture.md) §4. Where state
lives and which shards an operation touches live in §5 and §6 — those two
tables are the single source of truth; satellites explain them and never
restate them.

## 3. Done means

A change is finished when all of these hold. Do not stop early and do not
substitute one for another.

1. **It builds on a node** — never in the NFS home
   (see the fcstor deploy rule; a local `make` produces AVX-512 objects that
   SIGILL on the AMD test nodes).
2. **Unit tests pass:** `make test` (`test_sim`, `test_meta_apply`,
   `test_raft`, `test_kv_lsm`, `test_stage_evict`, … — no accepted-failure
   list).
3. **The gate from your routing row passes**, run with
   `tests/run_tests.sh <suite>`, and the result directory is recorded.
4. **A failure is a failure.** A timeout is not a skip; an empty TSV is not a
   pass; a suite that ran against a dead mount (`findmnt` not
   `fuse.efs-fuse`) did not run at all.
5. **The measurement is honest.** If you claim a speedup, it came from the
   documented method in [performance.md](performance.md), not from a cache.

---

## 4. Never, without asking

- Invent a design decision the spec does not contain (see §1).
- Restate a normative table in a satellite — link to its one home instead.
- Add a component as new monolith code; it lands inside the carved
  boundaries ([development.md](developing.md)).
- Weaken an invariant to make a test pass.
- Widen a timeout instead of removing the work that made it slow.

## 5. If you are an AI agent — or briefing one

This page exists so that a **less advanced model can produce a correct
change**. That works only if the task arrives pre-chewed: the model's job is
execution inside hard edges, not exploration. The briefer (human or
orchestrator) owns: picking the step (§1), decomposing it until every
instruction is mechanical, naming the exact files to read (§2 — the Read
column and nothing else), and reviewing the diff. The agent owns: staying
inside the named files, and the checklist in §3 — all of it.

A briefing that works, paste-able:

```text
You are making ONE behavior-preserving change to the efs repo.
Read first, in order, and read nothing else:
  docs/status/README.md, then only the files your routing row names.
Task: <one step, decomposed until mechanical: what moves, what does
not, what is forbidden>
Hard rules: no logic changes outside the task; no renames; no new
dependencies; no files outside the ones named; if anything seems to
need a design decision the spec does not contain, STOP and report —
do not decide.
Done means: builds on a test node (never in $HOME), make test passes,
the routing row's gate passes via tests/run_tests.sh, and you record
the result directory. A timeout is a failure. Verify the mount with
findmnt before trusting any suite result.
```

Two traps a pasted briefing must name because an outside agent cannot
rediscover them (the other recurring ones are already in §3):

- **EEXIST on a unique, never-used name is a bug, never benign.** Do not
  swallow it as a race and move on.
- **`pgrep -x`, never `pgrep -f`** on this project's processes — the `-f`
  pattern matches your own ssh command line and kills your own session.

## Keeping the agent handoff current

Start with [the status index](../status/README.md) and
[the current handoff](../status/in-flight.md), then the selected work item's
home and gates. Historical rollout results are not live cluster state.

When documenting a bug, feature, enhancement or investigation, allocate an
unused W identity and update the status index plus its detailed home together.
Record decisions in the D register without confusing approved design with
implemented code or accepted behavior. Keep implementation, local checks,
cluster gates and closure separate. Archive superseded checkpoint narratives
intact, repair links, and retain every unresolved gate in the active queue.
Regenerate architecture artifacts and run the documentation gate after edits.
